The

demonstrated
a
decreased

of
glucocorticoid

)
in
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
from
hypercholesterolemic
subjects
,
and
an
elevated
level
in

with
acute

In
the
lymphocytes

high
GR

dexamethasone
inhibited

incorporation
into

,
respectively
,
in
the

manner
as
in

.

On

other
hand
,
a
decreased
GR
number
resulted
in
a
less
efficient
dexamethasone

of
the
incorporation
of

.

These

showed
that
the

changed
only
with
a
decrease
of

At

)
could
serve
as
a
marker
of

,
the
authors
studied
specimens
of
breast
carcinomas
from
60
consecutive

.

Presence
of
beta

was
analyzed
by
immunohistochemistry
.

No
significant

were
found
between

such
as

However
,
there
was
a

,
is
shown
to
be
modulated
by
a

.

Mutation
of
a
kappa
B
core
sequence
identified
in
the

(
-206
to
-195
)
partially
inhibits
both
mitogen-
and
HTLV-I
Tax-mediated
activation
of
this
transcription
unit
and
blocks
the
specific

of
two

.

These
kappa
B-specific

(
80

kilodaltons
)
similarly
interact
with
the
functional
kappa
B
enhancer
present
in

These

that
these

to
address
this
question
.

Different
fragments

were
used
for

that
was
only
seen
with
nuclear

derived
from
B-cell
neoplasms
corresponding
to
the

to
be
dependent
on
the
actions
of
these

on
the
DNA
region
within

.

This
region
is
located
within
the
920
bp
fragment
located
210
bp
upstream
from
the

and
this
fragment
represents
a

[
Determination
of
the
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
in

]

A
modified
method
for
the
determination
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
human
lymphocytes
is
suggested
.

The
principal
distinction
of
the
method
is
standardization
by
the
lymphocyte
count
in
a
sample
(
1
mln
)
and
the
labeled
hormone
concentration
.

The
modification
saves
time
and
money
,
limits
the
range
of
the
data
variations
,
and
makes
use
of
a
lesser
volume
of
blood
.

Examinations
of
70
children
aged
4
to
15
suffering
from
the
nephrotic
form
of

have
made
it
possible
to
distinguish
two
groups
of
patients
:
with
relatively
high
values
of
specific
binding
X
=
6820.1
+/-
530.0
(
n
=
30
,
p
=
0.95
,
t
=
2.04
)
,
this
corresponding
to
a
clinical
form
of
hormone
-sensitive
glomerulonephritis
,
and
with
relatively
low
values
of
specific
binding
X
=
1815.2
+/-
302.8
(
n
=
40
,
p
=
0.95
,
t
=
1.96
)
,
that
corresponds
to
hormone
-resistant
glomerulonephritis
.

Dynamic
studies
have
not
shown
any
statistically
significant
changes
in
the
specific
binding
values
.

These
results
permit
regarding
the
specific
binding
value
as
a
prognostic
criterion
in
the
assessment
of
corticosteroid
therapy
;
this
allows
a
wide
employment
of

Octamer-binding
proteins
from
B
or
HeLa
cells
stimulate
transcription
of
the
immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
B-cell
-type
specificity
of
the
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
heavy-chain
and
light-chain
promoters
is
mediated
by
an
octanucleotide
(
OCTA
)
element
,
ATGCAAAT
,
that
is
also
a
functional
component
of
other
RNA
polymerase
II
promoters
,
such
as
snRNA
and
histone
H2B
promoters
.

Two
nuclear
proteins
that
bind
specifically
and
with
high
affinity
to
the
OCTA
element
have
been
identified
.

NF-A1
is
present
in
a
variety
of
cell
types
,
whereas
the
presence
of
NF-A2
is
essentially
confined
to
B
cells
,
leading
to
the
hypothesis
that
NF-A2
activates
cell-type-specific
transcription
of
the
Ig
promoter
and
NF-A1
mediates
the
other
responses
of
the
OCTA
element
.

Extracts
of
the
B-cell
line
,
BJA-B
,
contain
high
levels
of
NF-A2
and
specifically
transcribe
Ig
promoters
.

In
contrast
,
extracts
from
HeLa
cells
transcribed
the
Ig
promoter
poorly
.

Surprisingly
,
addition
of
either
affinity-enriched
NF-A2
or
NF-A1
to
either
a
HeLa
extract
or
a
partially
purified
reaction
system
specifically
stimulates
the
Ig
promoter
.

This
suggests
that
the
constitutive
OCTA-binding
factor
NF-A1
can
activate
transcription
of
the
Ig
promoter
and
that
B-cell
-specific
transcription
of
this
promoter
,
at
least
in
vitro
,
is
partially
due
to
a
quantitative
difference
in
the
amount
of
OCTA-binding
protein
.

Because
NF-A1
can
stimulate
Ig
transcription
,
the
inability
of
this
factor
to
activate
in
vivo
the
Ig
promoter
to
the
same
degree
as
the
snRNA
promoters
probably
reflects
a
difference
in
the
context
of
the
OCTA
element
in
these
two
types
of
promoters
.

Identification
of
a
putative
regulator
of
early
T
cell
activation
genes
.

Molecules
involved
in
the
antigen
receptor-dependent
regulation
of
early
T
cell
activation
genes
were
investigated
with
the
use
of
functional
sequences
of
the
T
cell
activation-specific
enhancer
of
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
.

One
of
these
sequences
forms
a
protein
complex
,
NFAT-1
,
specifically
with
nuclear
extracts
of
activated
T
cells
.

This
complex
appeared
10
to
25
minutes
before
the
activation
of
the
IL-2
gene
.

Studies
with
inhibitors
of
protein
synthesis
indicated
that
the
time
of
synthesis
of
the
activator
of
the
IL-2
gene
in
Jurkat
T
cells
corresponds
to
the
time
of
appearance
of
NFAT-1
.

NFAT-1
,
or
a
very
similar
protein
,
bound
functional
sequences
of
the
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
;
the
LTR
of
this
virus
is
known
to
be
stimulated
during
early
T
cell
activation
.

The
binding
site
for
this
complex
activated
a
linked
promoter
after
transfection
into
antigen
receptor-activated
T
cells
but
not
other
cell
types
.

These
characteristics
suggest
that
NFAT-1
transmits
signals
initiated
at
the
T
cell
antigen
receptor
.

Characterization
of
thyroid
hormone
receptors
in
human
IM-9
lymphocytes
.

Although
putatively
identified
more
than
10
years
ago
,
thyroid
hormone
receptors
in
human
tissues
remain
poorly
characterized
.

As
a
first
step
towards
understanding
the
mechanism
of
thyroid
hormone
action
in
man
we
have
characterized
T3
binding
sites
in
nuclei
of
the
human
lymphoblastoid
line
,
IM-9
cells
.

In
whole
cell
experiments
at
37
degrees
C
,
nuclear
binding
of
[
125I
]
T3
was
saturable
(
Kd
34
+/-
6
pmol/l
)
and
of
finite
capacity
(
approximately
equal
to
350
sites/cell
)
.

The
binding
sites
were
extracted
from
a
nuclear
pellet
by
treatment
with
0.4
mol/l
KCl
and
sonication
.

Separation
of
bound
from
free
[
125I
]
T3
in
the
extracts
was
achieved
using
the
calcium
phosphate
matrix
,
hydroxyapatite
at
a
concentration
of
0.3
ml
of
a
150
g/l
slurry
.

Rectilinear
Scatchard
plots
were
obtained
only
when
the
hydroxyapatite
was
washed
with
a
buffer
containing
0.5
%
Triton
X-100
.

Under
these
conditions
T3
binding
sites
in
the
nuclear
extracts
were
present
at
a
concentration
of
22.4
+/-
8.6
fmol/mg
protein
and
showed
an
affinity
of
(
Kd
,
room
temperature
)
140
+/-
10
pmol/l
.

The
same
assay
system
was
used
to
determine
the
hierarchy
of
affinities
for
a
range
of
natural
and
synthetic
analogues
.

Calling
T3
100
,
the
order
of
potencies
observed
was
:
Triac
,
500
;
3
,
5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyronine
,
89
;
T4
,
32
;

,
5-dimethyl-3'isopropylthyronine

;

,
5-T2
,
0.7
,
rT3
,
0.4
;
3'5'-T2
,
less
than
0.01
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
T3
binding
sites
present
in
human
IM-9
lymphocyte
nuclei
and
extracts
thereof
are
thyroid
hormone
receptors
.

These
cells
may
be
a
useful
tool
to
increase
our
understanding
of
human
T3
receptors

Definition
of
T-cell
specific
DNA-binding
factors
that
interact
with
a
3'-silencer
in
the
CD4+
T-cell
gene
Rpt-1
.

Analysis
of
the
region
3
'
to
the
CD4+
T-cell
gene
Rpt-1
(
encoding
regulatory
protein
T-lymphocyte
1
)
led
to
the
definition
of
a
silencer
element
that
inhibits
heterologous
gene
expression
in
certain
CD4+
T-cell
lines
but
not
in
B-cell
or
non-lymphoid
cell
lines
.

Functional
silencer
activity
in
vivo
was
associated
with
the
presence
of
a
specific
silencer-DNA-protein
complex
in
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
with
T-cell
extracts
.

Formation
of
this
complex
was
selectively
inhibited
by
the
region
in
HIV-1
containing
a
silencer
element
.

We
discuss
the
possibility
that
DNA-binding
factors
may
coregulate
HIV-1
and
Rpt-1
gene
expression
through
a
common
transcriptional
silencer
element
.

Congenital
immunodeficiencies
associated
with
absence
of
HLA
class
II
antigens
on
lymphocytes
result
from
distinct
mutations
in
trans-acting
factors
.

Coordinate
regulation
of
HLA
class
II
gene
expression
during
development
and
coinduction
of
class
II
genes
by
soluble
factors
suggests
that
common
trans-acting
factor
(
s
)
control
expression
of
these
genes
.

In
B-lymphoblastoid
cell
lines
derived
from
two
independent
class
II-deficient
bare
lymphocyte
syndrome
patients
,
we
observed
a
drastic
decrease
in
transcription
rates
of
the
class
II
genes
.

When
these
cell
lines
are
fused
,
class
II
genes
are
reexpressed
,
indicating
that
immunodeficiencies
in
bare
lymphocyte
syndrome
patients
are
the
result
of
two
distinct
mutations
.

Further
studies
show
that
genes
governing
the
expression
of
class
II
antigens
fall
into
at
least
three
complementation
groups
;
two
of
these
were
previously
unidentified
in
mutant
cell
lines
generated
in

.

In
addition
,
we
report
the
identification
of
two
discrete
complexes
,
NFX1.1
and
NFX1.2
,
that
bind
to
the
DRA
X
consensus
element
.

Though
the
mutation
in
at

one
mutant
line
generated
in

(
RJ2.2.5
)
affects
products
functioning
via
interaction
with
the
X
box
,
clear
alterations
in
either
NFX1.1
or
NFX1.2
are
not

in
any
of
the

after

.

In
addition
,
there
was
a
significant
correlation
between
the
maximum
increase
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
and
the
maximum
decrease
in
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.7514
,
p
less
than
0.0003
)
.

Simultaneous
measurements
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
by
whole-cell
assay
revealed
that
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
linearly
correlated
with
that
in
the
corresponding
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.9482
,
p
less
than
0.0001
)
.

There
were
also
significant
correlations
between
the
maximum
increase
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
and
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
r
=
0.7239
,
p
less

0.0007
)
,
and
between
the
maximum
decrease
in

and
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
lymphocytes
(
r
=
0.7703
,
p
less
than
0.0002
)
.

These
results
suggest
that
individual
differences
are
preserved
both
in
glucocorticoid
responsiveness
and
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
in
peripheral
blood
leukocytes
in
normal
humans
.

Estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
in
hepatitis
B
virus
carriers
treated
with
interferon-alpha
.

Estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
and
the
effects
of
interferon-alpha
(
IFN-alpha
)
on
estradiol
receptors
were
studied
in
asymptomatic
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
carriers
,
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
and
normal
controls
.

The
level
of
estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
mononuclear
cells
was
significantly
lower
in
asymptomatic
HBV
carriers
and
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
,
compared
to
normal
controls
.

This
low
level
of
cytosol
estradiol
receptors
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
was
increased
by
the
administration
of
IFN-alpha
.

In
addition
,
when
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
from
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
B
were
incubated
with
IFN-alpha
in
vitro
,
the
level
of
cytosol
estradiol
receptors
also
increased
by
increasing
the
concentration
of
IFN-alpha
.

We
previously
reported
that
the
response
of
mononuclear
cells
to
estrogen
is
impaired
in
HBV
carriers
,
and
our
present
results
suggested
that
this
may
be
due
to
the
low
level
of
estradiol
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
mononuclear
cells
.

Association
of
increased
lytic
effector
cell
function
with
high
estrogen
receptor
levels
in
tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
.

Tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
were
assayed
for
their
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cell
activity
and
for
the
function
of
activated
cytotoxic
T-cells
,
as
assessed
by
lectin-dependent
cellular
cytotoxicity
(
LDCC
)
.

Tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
had
a
significant
increase
in
NK
activity
and
in
LDCC
,
as
compared
with
healthy
control
individuals
.

Although
the
enhanced
NK
cell
activity
and
LDCC
were
closely
associated
with
high
levels
(
greater
than
31
fmol/mg
)
of
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
content
in
the
primary
tumor
,
no
other
clinical
or
histologic
correlation
between
the
increase
in
either
parameter
of
cytotoxic
effector
cell
function
could
be
found
.

Thus
,
ER
levels
greater
than
31
fmol/mg
might
be
associated
with
increased
cytotoxic
effector
cell
function
in
tumor-bearing
patients
with
breast
cancer
.

Properties
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
lymphocytes
from
patients
with
familial
cortisol
resistance
.

In
a
previous
report
of
two
patients
with
familial
glucocorticoid
resistance
due
to
reduced
numbers
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
,
we
have
shown
decreased
numbers
of
GR
in
peripheral
mononuclear
cells
and
cultured
fibroblasts
but
normal
affinity
of
GR
in
both
patients
.

In
this
study
,
peripheral
lymphocytes
from
these
patients
,
one
patient
's
son
and
daughter
,
and
normal
subjects
were
transformed
with
Epstein-Barr
virus
.

Reduced
numbers
and
normal
affinity
of
GR
were
found
in
the
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
lymphocytes
from
both
patients
while
the
son
and
daughter
had
normal
numbers
and
affinity
of
GR
.

The
thermal
stability
of
GR
and
thermal
activation
of
cytosolic
receptors
in
both
patients
were
found
to
be
normal
.

Although
the
percentages
of
nuclear
bound
GR
were
similar
in
both
patients
and
normal
controls
,
the
absolute
amounts
of
nuclear
bound
GR
of
the
patients
were
about
one-half
that
of
normal
controls
.

These
abnormal
properties
of
GR
(
reduced
numbers
of
GR
)
were
preserved
in
the
transformed
cells
from
the
patients
.

Octamer
transcription
factors
1
and
2
each
bind
to
two
different
functional
elements
in
the
immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
promoter
.

Immunoglobulin
heavy-chain
genes
contain
two
conserved
sequence
elements
5
'
to
the
site
of
transcription
initiation
:
the
octamer
ATGCAAAT
and
the
heptamer
CTCATGA
.

Both
of
these
elements
are
required
for
normal
cell-specific
promoter
function
.

The
present
study
demonstrates
that
both
the
ubiquitous
and
lymphoid-cell-specific
octamer
transcription
factors
(
OTF-1
and
OTF-2
,
respectively
)
interact
specifically
with
each
of
the
two
conserved
sequence
elements
,
forming
either
homo-
or
heterodimeric
complexes
.

This
was
surprising
,
since
the
heptamer
and
octamer
sequence
motifs
bear
no
obvious
similarity
to
each
other
.

Binding
of
either
factor
to
the
octamer
element
occurred
independently
.

However
,
OTF
interaction
with
the
heptamer
sequence
appeared
to
require
the
presence
of
an
intact
octamer
motif
and
occurred
with
a
spacing
of
either
2
or
14
base
pairs
between
the
two
elements
,
suggesting
coordinate
binding
resulting
from
protein-protein
interactions
.

The
degeneracy
in
sequences
recognized
by
the
OTFs
may
be
important
in
widening
the
range
over
which
gene
expression
can
be
modulated
and
in
establishing
cell
type
specificity
.

Identification
of
a
novel
lymphoid
specific
octamer
binding
protein
(
OTF-2B
)
by
proteolytic
clipping
bandshift
assay
(
PCBA
)
.

The
octamer
sequence
ATGCAAAT
is
found
in
the
promoters
of
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
heavy
and
light
chain
genes
and
in
the
heavy
chain
enhancer
and
is
a
major
determinant
of
the
cell
type
specific
expression
of
Ig
genes
in
B
cells
.

An
apparent
paradox
is
that
the
same
sequence
serves
as
an
upstream
promoter
or
enhancer
element
in
a
variety
of
housekeeping
genes
such
as
the
histone
H2B
and
U
snRNA
genes
.

The
differential
usage
of
this
regulatory
sequence
motif
is
thought
to
be
mediated
by
different
species
of
octamer
binding
proteins
.

One
species
of
100
kd
,
designated
OTF-1
,
is
present
in
all
cell
types
and
may
exert
its
activating
function
only
when
it
can
interact
with
additional
adjacent
transcription
factors
.

The
lymphoid
cell
specific
octamer
binding
protein
of
60
kd
(
OTF-2A
)
specifically
stimulates
Ig
promoters
which
consist
essentially
of
a
TATA-box
and
an
octamer
sequence
upstream
of
it
.

Here
we
present
evidence
for
yet
another
B
cell
specific
octamer
binding
protein
of
75
kd
(
OTF-2B
)
.

From
several
findings
,
including
the
absence
of
OTF-2B
(
but
not
OTF-2A
)
from
a
lymphocyte
line
that
can
not
respond
to
the
IgH
enhancer
,
we
propose
a
role
of
the
novel
octamer
factor
in
the
long
range
activation
by
the
IgH
enhancer
.

We
have
used
the
proteolytic
clipping
bandshift
assay
(
PCBA
)
technique
to
distinguish
the
three
different
forms
found
in
B
cells
.

This
analysis
indicates
that
the
75
kd-species
OTF-2B
is
closely
related
to
the
60
kd
species
OTF-2A
.

Inhibition
of
interleukin
2
-induced
proliferation
of
cloned
murine
T
cells
by
glucocorticoids
.

Possible
involvement
of
an
inhibitory
protein
.

The
ability
of
glucocorticoids
to
inhibit
interleukin
2
(
IL
2
)
-induced
T
cell
proliferation
in
two
cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CTL
)
clones
has
been
studied
.

A
complete
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
by
dexamethasone
(
Dx
)
could
be
observed
when
IL
2-depleted
cultures
of
CTL
were
either
incubated
for
6
h
with
the
hormone
prior
to
the
addition
of
IL
2
or
treated
simultaneously
with
Dx
and
a
low
concentration
of
IL
2
.

No
significant
reduction
in
the
number
and
affinity
of
IL
2
receptors
was
seen
after
6
h
incubation
with
Dx
.

The
order
of
potency
observed
with
the
different
steroids
indicated
that
this
inhibitory
effect
was
mediated
through
binding
to
a
specific
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

The
action
of
these
hormones
possibly
involves
the
synthesis
of
an
inhibitory
protein
(
s
)
,
since
the
presence
of
cycloheximide
during
the
incubation
with
Dx
prevented
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
.

Furthermore
,
supernatant
from
Dx-treated
CTL
contained
a
nondialyzable
factor
which
inhibited
DNA
synthesis
and
cell
growth
of
CTL
clones
induced
by
IL
2
.

Blocking
of
IL
2
synthesis
and
IL
2
receptor
formation
have
been
proposed
as
one
of
the
major
mechanisms
of
glucocorticoid-induced
immunosuppression
.

Our
results
indicate
that
these
hormones
may
also
affect
T
cell
proliferation
by
inhibiting
IL
2
activity
.

Identification
and
purification
of
a
human
immunoglobulin-enhancer-binding
protein
(
NF-kappa
B
)
that
activates
transcription
from
a
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
enhancer-binding
factor
NF-kappa
B
,
which
is
found
only
in
cells
that
transcribe
immunoglobulin
light
chain
genes
,
has
been
purified
from
nuclear
extracts
of
Namalwa
cells
(
human
Burkitt
lymphoma
cells
)
by
sequence-specific
DNA
affinity
chromatography
.

The
purified
NF-kappa
B
has
been
identified
as
a
51-kDa
polypeptide
by
UV-crosslinking
analysis
.

``
Footprint
''
and
methylation-interference
analyses
have
shown
that
purified
NF-kappa
B
has
a
binding
activity
specific
for
the
kappa
light
chain
enhancer
sequence
.

The
purified
factor
activated
in

transcription
of
the
human

type
I
promoter
by
binding
to
an
upstream

Lymphocyte
glucocorticoid
receptor
binding
in
depression
:
normal
values
following
recovery
.

The
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
in
lymphocytes
and
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
were
measured
in
20
patients
who
had
recovered
from
major
depressive
disorder
and
20
healthy
control
subjects
.

The
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
in
lymphocytes
from
the
recovered
depressed
group
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
control
group
.

Although
the
mean
plasma
cortisol
concentration
in
recovered
depressives
was
higher
than
in
control
subjects
,
the
difference
only
just
reached
significance
.

This
study
shows
that
the
reduction
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
numbers
which
occurs
during
acute
depressive
illness
does
not
persist
on
recovery
and
is
,
therefore
,
state-dependent
.

Identification
and
purification
of
a
human
lymphoid-specific
octamer-binding
protein
(
OTF-2
)
that
activates
transcription
of
an
immunoglobulin
promoter
in
vitro
.

The
octamer
sequence
5'-ATGCAAAT
,
in
either
orientation
,
serves
as
an
upstream
element
in
a
variety
of
promoters
and
also
occurs
as
a
modular
enhancer
element
.

It
is
of
particular
interest
in
immunoglobulin
genes
since
it
is
found
in
the
upstream
regions
of
all
heavy
and
light
chain
promoters
and
in
the
heavy
chain
enhancer
,
both
of
which
are
known
to
be
necessary
for
cell-specific
expression
.

We
report
here
the
chromatographic
separation
of
ubiquitous
and
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
proteins
.

The
B
cell
factor
was
purified
to
homogeneity
using
affinity
chromatography
and
consists
of
three
peptides
of
62
,
61
,
and
58.5
+/-
1.5
kd
.

Each
of
the
polypeptides
was
renatured
after
SDS-PAGE
and
shown
to
bind
to
the
octamer
sequence
.

The
specific
DNA
binding
activity
of
the
pure
B
cell-specific
factor
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
the
affinity-purified
ubiquitous
factor
.

This
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
factor
,
in
pure
form
,
activated
transcription
from
a
kappa
light
chain
promoter
in
vitro
,
thus
demonstrating
that
it
is
indeed
a
B
cell-specific
transcription
factor
for
this
gene
.

In
addition
to
the
ubiquitous
and
B
cell-specific
octamer-binding
factors
,
we
identified
several
additional
proteins
,
one
of
which
is
B
cell
-specific
,
that
interact
with
the
kappa
promoter
.

Decreased
deoxyribonucleic
acid
binding
of
glucocorticoid-receptor
complex
in
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
a
patient
with
the
glucocorticoid
resistance
syndrome
.

A
patient
with
the
syndrome
of
glucocorticoid
resistance
was
studied
.

A
27-yr-old
woman
initially
was
diagnosed
as
having
Cushing
's
disease
,
based
on
the
findings
of
high
plasma
ACTH
and
serum
cortisol
levels
,
increased
urinary
cortisol
secretion
,
resistance
to
adrenal
suppression
with
dexamethasone
,
and
bilateral
adrenal
hyperplasia
by
computed
tomography
and
scintigraphy
of
the
adrenal
glands
.

However
,
she
had
no
signs
or
symptoms
of
Cushing
's
syndrome
.

During
a
5-yr
follow-up
,
no
clinical
abnormalities
developed
,
although
hypercortisolism
persisted
.

End-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
was
suspected
.

To
explain
the
end-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
,
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
in
peripheral
mononuclear
leukocytes
and
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
a
forearm
skin
biopsy
were
characterized
and
compared
with
the
results
of
similar
studies
in
normal
subjects
.

The
patient
's
GR
in
whole
cell
assays
had
an
increased
dissociation
constant
(
Kd
)
.

In
the
cytosol
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
the
patient
,
there
was
also
decreased
binding
capacity
.

The
thermal
stability
and
the
sedimentation
coefficient
in
a
sucrose
density
gradient
of
the
receptors
in
the
cytosol
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
the
patient
and
normal
subjects
were
similar
.

GR
complex
activation
,
analyzed
by
DEAE-cellulose
chromatography
,
was
decreased
in
the
patient
.

DNA
binding
of
the
GR
complex
after
temperature-induced
activation
was
lower
in
the
patient
than
in
normal
subjects
.

Nuclear
translocation
of
GR
complexes
from
the
patient
was
also
slightly
decreased
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
patient
's
glucocorticoid
resistance
was
due
to
a
decrease
in
the
affinity
of
the
receptor
for
glucocorticoids
and
a
decrease
in
the
binding
of
the
GR
complex
to
DNA
.

Granulocyte-macrophage

.

Sensitive
and
receptor-mediated
regulation
by
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
in
normal
human
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
.

We
show
that
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
1
,
25
[
OH
]
2D3
)
,
the
most
hormonally
active
metabolite
of
vitamin
D3
,
modulates
sensitively
and
specifically
both
the
protein
and
messenger
RNA
accumulation
of
the
multilineage
growth
factor
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
.

The
regulation
of
GM-CSF
expression
is
seen
in
both
normal
human
mitogen-activated
T
lymphocytes
and
T
lymphocytes
from
a
line
(
S-LB1
)
transformed
with
human
T
cell
lymphotropic
virus
1
(
HTLV-1
)
.

In
contrast
,
cells
from
a
HTLV-1
transformed
T
lymphocyte
line
(
Ab-VDR
)
established
from
a
patient
with
vitamin
D-resistant
rickets
type
II
with
undetectable
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
cellular
receptors
are
resistant
to
the
action
of
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
.

Inhibition
of
GM-CSF
expression
by
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
can
occur
independently
of
interleukin
2
regulation
and
is
probably
mediated
through
cellular
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
receptors
.

We
conclude
that
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
may
be
important
in
the
physiology
of
hematopoiesis
.

Altered
interaction
between
triiodothyronine
and
its
nuclear
receptors
in
absence
of
cortisol
:
a
proposed
mechanism
for
increased
thyrotropin
secretion
in
corticosteroid
deficiency
states
.

Thyroid
hormones
occasionally
appear
less
effective
when
administered
alone
to
patients
with
panhypopituitarism
,
and
manifestations
suggestive
of
hypothyroidism
have
been
reported
in
patients
suffering
from
untreated
Addison
's
disease
.

In
the
latter
condition
,
thyrotropin
secretion
is
increased
:
this
occurs
already
after
as
little
as
2
days
of
temporary
withdrawal
of
therapy
with
substitution
doses
of
corticosteroids
while
circulating
levels
of
thyroid
hormones
remain
within
normal
limits
.

Therefore
,
a
possible
role
of
cortisol
in
interaction
between
triiodothyronine
and
its
nuclear
receptors
was
examined
at
the
level
of
circulating
lymphocytes
obtained
from
patients
with
primary
or
secondary
adrenocortical
failure
.

The
affinity
of
these
receptors
was
found
to
be
decreased
,
by
more
than
50
%
on
average
,
in
the
absence
of
cortisol
treatments
.

This
change
was
promptly
corrected
upon
resumption
of
therapy
.

The
number
of
binding
sites
was
not
significantly
modified
.

The
influence
of
cortisol
on
thyroid
hormone
receptors
discussed
here
might
account
for
the
clinical
observations
mentioned
above
.

Inhibition
by
cortisol
of
human
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cell
activity
.

The
effects
of
cortisol
on
the
natural
killer
(
NK
)
activity
of
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
(
PBM
)
cells
were
studied
in
vitro
using
a
direct
4-h
51Cr-release
assay
and
K
562
cell
line
as
a
target
.

Preincubation
for
20
h
of
PBM
cells
drawn
from
healthy
donors
with
1
X
10
(
-8
)
to
1
X
10
(
-5
)
M
cortisol
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
of
NK
cell
activity
.

The
magnitude
of
the
suppression
was
directly
related
to
the
steroid
concentration
and
inversely
related
to
the
number
of
effector
cells
.

Cortisol
was
able
to
minimize
the
enhancement
of
NK
cytotoxicity
obtainable
in
the
presence
of
immune
interferon
(
IFN-gamma
)
.

A
significantly
higher
suppression
was
achieved
after
sequential
exposure
of
PBM
cells
to
cortisol
and
equimolar
levels
of
prostaglandin
E2
(
PgE2
)
.

The
concomitant
incubation
with
theophylline
and
isobutyl-methylxanthine
failed
to
enhance
the
cortisol-induced
suppression
,
whereas
PgE2-dependent
inhibition
significantly
increased
after
exposure
of
PBM
cells
to
methyl-xanthines
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
cortisol
was
partially
or
totally
prevented
by
the
concomitant
incubation
with
equimolar
amounts
of
11-deoxycortisol
and
RU
486
but
not
of
progesterone
.

Treatment
of
NK
effectors
with
a
monoclonal
anti-human
corticosteroid-binding
globulin
(
CBG
)
antibody
produced
an
enhancement
of
the
spontaneous
NK
activity
and
a
partial
suppression
of
cortisol-mediated
effects
.

Our
results
suggest
that
endogenous
glucocorticoids
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
NK
cell-mediated
cytotoxicity
.

Since
the
effect
of
cortisol
was
additive
to
that
of
PgE2
and
was
not
changed
by
phosphodiesterase
inhibitors
,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
hormone
acts
at
a
level
different
from
the
adenylate
cyclase
-
phosphodiesterase
system
.

Data
obtained
with
the
use
of
antiglucocorticoids
and
the
anti-CBG
antibody
are
compatible
with
a
role
both
of
high-affinity
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
of
CBG
in
mediating
cortisol
action
on
the
human
NK
cell
activity
.

Interaction
of
cell-type-specific
nuclear
proteins
with
immunoglobulin
VH
promoter
region
sequences
.

All
human
and
murine
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
variable
region
(
VH
)
genes
contain
the
sequence
ATGCAAAT
approximately
70
nucleotides
5
'
from
the
site
of
transcription
initiation
.

This
octanucleotide
,
in
reverse
orientation
,
is
also
found
in
all
light
chain
variable
region
(
VL
)
genes
,
and
in
the
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
transcriptional
enhancer
.

Transfection
studies
have
established
that
this
octamer
is
involved
in
the
lymphoid-specific
transcription
of
immunoglobulin
genes
.

Octamer-containing
fragments
have
been
reported
to
bind
a
factor
present
in
nuclear
extracts
of
human
cell
lines
;
however
,
identical
binding
activity
was
detected
in
both
B
lymphoid
and
non-lymphoid
cells
.

Here
we
establish
that
nuclear
extracts
from
distinct
cell
types
differ
in
their
ability
to
interact
with
octamer-containing
fragments
.

We
have
also
detected
a
DNA-protein
interaction
that
may
be
involved
in
the
cell-type
specificity
of
immunoglobulin
expression
,
and
we
have
determined
that
a
sequence
upstream
of
the
octamer
participates
in
an
interaction
with
a
nuclear
protein
(
s
)
.

Preferential
transcription
of
HTLV-I
LTR
in
cell-free
extracts
of
human
T
cells
producing
HTLV-I
viral
proteins
.

The
promoters
of
the
adenovirus
2
major
late
gene
,
the
mouse
beta-globin
gene
,
the
mouse
immunoglobulin
VH
gene
and
the
LTR
of
the
human
T-lymphotropic
retrovirus
type
I
were
tested
for
their
transcription
activities
in
cell-free
extracts
of
four
cell
lines
;
HeLa
,
CESS
(
Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
human
B
cell
line
)
,
MT-1
(
HTLV-I-infected
human
T
cell
line
without
viral
protein
synthesis
)
,
and
MT-2
(
HTLV-I-infected
human
T
cell
line
producing
viral
proteins
)
.

LTR
was
preferentially
transcribed
in
the
extracts
of
MT-2
although
the
other
three
genes
were
transcribed
with
relatively
constant
efficiencies
in
different
extracts
.

The
results
agree
well
with
the
previous
in
vivo
studies
on
the
promoter
activity
of
HTLV-I
LTR
.

Mixing
of
HeLa
and
MT-2
extracts
revealed
the
presence
of
a
LTR-specific
stimulating
activity
in
MT-2
extracts
.

A
nuclear
factor
that
binds
to
a
conserved
sequence
motif
in
transcriptional
control
elements
of
immunoglobulin
genes
.

Trans-acting
factors
that
mediate
B-cell
specific
transcription
of
immunoglobulin
genes
have
been
postulated
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
expression
of
exogenously
introduced
immunoglobulin
gene
recombinants
in
lymphoid
and
non-lymphoid
cells
.

Two
B-cell-specific
,
cis-acting
transcriptional
regulatory
elements
have
been
identified
.

One
element
is
located
in
the
intron
between
the
variable
(
V
)
and
constant
(
C
)
regions
of
both
heavy
and
kappa
light-chain
genes
and
acts
as
a
transcriptional
enhancer
.

The
second
element
is
found
upstream
of
both
heavy
and
kappa
light-chain
gene
promoters
.

This
element
directs
lymphoid-specific
transcription
even
in
the
presence
of
viral
enhancers
.

We
have
sought
nuclear
factors
that
might
bind
specifically
to
these
two
regulatory
elements
by
application
of
a
modified
gel
electrophoresis
DNA
binding
assay
.

We
report
here
the
identification
of
a
human
B-cell
nuclear
factor
(
IgNF-A
)
that
binds
to
DNA
sequences
in
the
upstream
regions
of
both
the
mouse
heavy
and
kappa
light-chain
gene
promoters
and
also
to
the
mouse
heavy-chain
gene
enhancer
.

This
sequence-specific
binding
is
probably
mediated
by
a
highly
conserved
sequence
motif
,
ATTTGCAT
,
present
in
all
three
transcriptional
elements
.

Interestingly
,
a
factor
showing
similar
binding
specificity
to
IgNF-A
is
also
present
in
human
HeLa
cells
.

The
new
world
primates
as
animal
models
of
glucocorticoid
resistance
.

Many
New
World
primate
species
have
greatly
increased
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
,
decreased
plasma
cortisol
binding
globulin
capacity
and
affinity
,
marked
resistance
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
to
suppression
by
dexamethasone
,
and
no
biological
evidence
of
glucocorticoid
excess
.

These
primates
also
have
high
levels
of
circulating
progesterone
,
estrogen
,
mineralocorticoid
,
androgen
and
vitamin
D
.

The
glucocorticoid
target
tissues
that
have
been
examined
(
circulating
mononuclear
lymphocytes
and
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
)
have
normal
concentrations
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
with
decreased
affinity
for
dexamethasone
.

Transformation
of
B-lymphocytes
with
the
Epstein-Barr
virus
leads
to
glucocorticoid
receptor
induction
that
is
less
than
that
observed
with
cells
from
Old
World
primates
.

The
receptor
in
these
cells
has
a
low
affinity
for
dexamethasone
.

The
low
affinity
leads
to
an
increased
loss
of
specific
bound
ligand
during
thermal
activation
.

Meroreceptor
generation
is
normal
.

The
molecular
weight
of
the
receptor
,
determined
by
SDS-PAGE
,
is
similar
to
that
of
Old
World
primates
(
approximately
92
,
000
)
and
the
activation
pattern
per
se
,
examined
in
vitro
by
heating
cytosol
and
performing
phosphocellulose
chromatography
,
appears
similar
to
that
of
human
controls
.

The
ratios
of
nuclear
to
cytosolic
hormone-receptor-complexes
and
of
cytosolic
activated
to
unactivated
receptor
complexes
in
intact
cells
are
similar
to
Old
World
primates
.

Results
from
mixing
studies
do
not
support
the
hypothesis
that
a
binding
inhibitor
(
s
)
or
a
deficient
cytosolic
positive
modifier
(
s
)
of
binding
underlies
the
findings
in
these
primates
.

The
New
World
primates
,
unlike
men
with
the
syndrome
of
primary
cortisol
resistance
,
have
compensated
for
their
condition
with
intra-adrenal
and
mineralocorticoid
receptor
adaptations
.

Thus
,
unlike
Old
World
primates
,
cortisol
in
New
World
primates
has
only
weak
sodium-retaining
potency
because
the
aldosterone
receptor
has
a
low
affinity
for
cortisol
.

The
common
element
that
would
explain
the
apparent
resistance
to
six
steroid
hormones
in
New

Acetylation
and
modulation
of
erythroid
Kruppel-like
factor
(
EKLF
)
activity
by
interaction
with
histone
acetyltransferases
.

Erythroid
Kruppel-like
factor
(
EKLF
)
is
a
red
cell-specific
transcriptional
activator
that
is
crucial
for
consolidating
the
switch
to
high
levels
of
adult
beta-globin
expression
during
erythroid
ontogeny
.

EKLF
is
required
for
integrity
of
the
chromatin
structure
at
the
beta-like
globin
locus
,
and
it
interacts
with
a
positive-acting
factor
in
vivo
.

We
find
that
EKLF
is
an
acetylated
transcription
factor
,
and
that
it
interacts
in
vivo
with
CBP
,
p300
,
and
P/CAF
.

However
,
its
interactions
with
these
histone
acetyltransferases
are
not
equivalent
,
as
CBP
and
p300
,
but
not
P/CAF
,
utilize
EKLF
as
a
substrate
for
in
vitro
acetylation
within
its
trans-activation
region
.

The
functional
effects
of
these
interactions
are
that
CBP
and
p300
,
but
not
P/CAF
,
enhance
EKLF
's
transcriptional
activation
of
the
beta-globin
promoter
in
erythroid
cells
.

These
results
establish
EKLF
as
a
tissue-specific
transcription
factor
that
undergoes
post-translational
acetylation
and
suggest
a
mechanism
by
which
EKLF
is
able
to
alter
chromatin
structure
and
induce
beta-globin
expression
within
the
beta-like
globin
cluster
.

Recognition
of
herpes
simplex
virus
type
2
tegument
proteins
by
CD4
T
cells
infiltrating
human
genital
herpes
lesions
.

The
local
cellular
immune
response
to
herpes
simplex
virus
(
HSV
)
is
important
in
the
control
of
recurrent
HSV
infection
.

The
antiviral
functions
of
infiltrating
CD4-bearing
T
cells
may
include
cytotoxicity
,
inhibition
of
viral
growth
,
lymphokine
secretion
,
and
support
of
humoral
and
CD8
responses
.

The
antigens
recognized
by
many
HSV-specific
CD4
T
cells
localizing
to
genital
HSV-2
lesions
are
unknown
.

T
cells
recognizing
antigens
encoded
within
map
units
0.67
to
0.73
of
HSV
DNA
are
frequently
recovered
from
herpetic
lesions
.

Expression
cloning
with
this
region
of
DNA
now
shows
that
tegument
protein
VP22
and
the
viral
dUTPase
,
encoded
by
genes
UL49
and
UL50
,
respectively
,
are
T-cell
antigens
.

Separate
epitopes
in
VP22
were
defined
for
T-cell
clones
from
each
of
three
patients
.

Reactivity
with
the
tegument
protein
encoded
by
UL21
was
identified
for
an
additional
patient
.

Three
new
epitopes
were
identified
in
VP16
,
a
tegument
protein
associated
with
VP22
.

Some
tegument-specific
CD4
T-cell
clones
exhibited
cytotoxic
activity
against
HSV-infected
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
herpes
simplex
tegument
proteins
are
processed
for
antigen
presentation
in
vivo
and
are
possible
candidate
compounds
for
herpes
simplex
vaccines
.

Fibrinogen
activates
NF-kappa
B
transcription
factors
in
mononuclear
phagocytes
.

Adhesion
to
extracellular
matrices
is
known
to
modulate
leukocyte
activation
,
although
the
mechanisms
are
not
fully
understood
.

Mononuclear
phagocytes
are
exposed
to
fibrinous
provisional
matrix
throughout
migration
into
inflammatory
foci
,
so
this
study
was
undertaken
to
determine
whether
fibrinogen
triggers
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
transcription
factors
.

U937
cells
differentiated
with
PMA
in
nonadherent
culture
were
shown
to
express
two
fibrinogen-binding
integrins
,
predominately
CD11b/CD18
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
,
CD11c/CD18
.

Cells
stimulated
with
fibrinogen
(
10-100
microg/ml
)
/Mn2+
(
50
microM
)
for
2
h
were
examined
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
.

NF-kappa
B
activation
,
minimal
in
unstimulated
cells
,
was
substantially
up-regulated
by
fibrinogen
.

Fibrinogen
also
caused
activation
of
AP-1
,
but
not
SP1
or
cAMP
response
element-binding
protein
(
CREB
)
factors
.

Blocking
mAbs
against
CD18
and
CD11b
abrogated
fibrinogen
-induced
NF-kappa
B
activation
.

To
determine
the
effects
on
transcriptional
regulation
,
U937
cells
were
transfected
with
a
plasmid
containing
the
HIV-1
enhancer
(
bearing
two
NF-kappa
B
sites
)
coupled
to
a
chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
(
CAT
)
reporter
.

Cells
were
subsequently
stimulated
with
1
)
PMA
for
24
h
,
inducing
CAT
activity
by
2.6-fold

h
,
inducing

)
costimulation
with
fibrinogen
and
PMA
,
inducing
5.7-fold
the
CAT
activity
induced
by
PMA
alone
.

We
conclude
that
contact
with
fibrinogen-derived
proteins
may
contribute
to
mononuclear
phagocyte
activation
by
signaling
through
CD11b/CD18
,
resulting
in
selective
activation
of
transcriptional
regulatory
factors
,
including
NF-kappa
B
.

Peripheral
blood
T
cells
and
monocytes
and
B
cell
lines
derived
from
patients
with
lupus
express
estrogen
receptor
transcripts
similar
to
those
of
normal
cells
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
identify
and
characterize
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
transcripts
expressed
in
immune
cells
of
patients
with
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(
SLE
)
and
healthy
donors
.

METHODS
:
Peripheral
blood
monocytes
and
T
cells
were
prepared
from
patients
with
SLE
(
n
=
6
)
and
healthy
donors
(
n
=
8
)
.

T
cells
were
separated
into
CD4
and
CD8
.

Some
monocytes
and
T
cells
were
stimulated
with
estradiol
,
PMA
,
and
ionomycin
.

Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed
B
cell
lines
(
n
=
7
)
and
B
cell
hybridomas
(
n
=
2
)
established
from
patients
with
SLE
and
a
healthy
individual
were
used
as
a
B
cell
source
.

These
cells
were
examined
for
ER
mRNA
by
reverse
transcription
nested
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

Amplified
cDNA
were
sequenced
by
standard
methods
.

RESULTS
:
In
all
cells
tested
,
ER
mRNA
was
expressed
without
prior
in
vitro
stimulation
.

Partial
sequences
from
exons
1-8
were
nearly
identical
to
the
published
sequence
of
the
human
ER
mRNA
.

There
were
no
notable
differences
in
the
ER
transcripts
between
patients
and
healthy
controls
.

Variant
receptor
transcripts
lacking
exon
5
or
exon
7
,
which
encodes
the
hormone
binding
domain
,
were
identified
in
the
majority
of
the
cells
.

Precise
deletion
of
the
exons
suggests
that
they
are
alternatively
spliced
transcripts
.

Whether
the
detected
transcripts
are
translated
into
functional
receptor
proteins
remains
to
be
determined
.

In
vitro
stimulation
did
not
affect
ER
mRNA
expression
.

The
presence
of
variants
did
not
correlate
with
disease
activity
or
medication
.

CONCLUSION
:
Monocytes
,
T
cells
,
and
B
cells
in
patients
express
transcripts
of
the
normal
wild
type
ER
and
the
hormone
binding
domain
variants
in
vivo
.

DNA
damaging
agents
induce
expression
of
Fas
ligand
and
subsequent
apoptosis
in
T
lymphocytes
via
the
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
and
AP-1
.

Apoptosis
induced
by
DNA
damage
and
other
stresses
can
proceed
via
expression
of
Fas
ligand
(
FasL
)
and
ligation
of
its
receptor
,
Fas
(
CD95
)
.

We
report
that
activation
of
the
two
transcription
factors
NF-kappa
B
and
AP-1
is
crucially
involved
in
FasL
expression
induced
by
etoposide
,
teniposide
,
and
UV
irradiation
.

A
nondegradable
mutant
of
I
kappa
B
blocked
both
FasL
expression
and
apoptosis
induced
by
DNA
damage
but
not
Fas
ligation
.

These
stimuli
also
induced
the
stress-activated
kinase
pathway
(
SAPK/JNK
)
,
which
was
required
for
the
maximal
induction
of
apoptosis
.

A
1.2
kb
FasL
promoter
responded
to
DNA
damage
,
as
well
as
coexpression
with
p65
Rel
or
Fos/Jun
.

Mutations
in
the
relevant
NF-kappa
B
and
AP-1
binding
sites
eliminated
these
responses
.

Thus
,
activation
of
NF-kappa

A
nonpeptidyl
small
molecule
SB
247464
,
capable
of
activating
granulocyte-colony-stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
signal
transduction
pathways
,
was
identified
in
a
high-throughput
assay
in
cultured
cells
.

Like
G-CSF
,
SB
247464
induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
multiple
signaling
proteins
and
stimulated
primary
murine
bone
marrow
cells
to
form
granulocytic
colonies
in
vitro
.

It
also
elevated
peripheral
blood
neutrophil
counts
in
mice
.

The
extracellular
domain
of
the
murine
G-CSF
receptor
was
required
for
the
activity
of
SB
247464
,
suggesting
that
the
compound
acts
by
oligomerizing
receptor
chains
.

The
results
indicate
that
a
small
molecule
can
activate
a
receptor
that
normally
binds
a
relatively
large
protein
ligand
.

Minimal

with
PML/RAR
alpha
or
AML1/ETO
mRNA
and
phenotypic
analysis
of
possible
T
and

in

.

Here
we
studied
minimal
residual
disease
(
MRD
)
of
patients
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
(
AML
)
who
have
PML/RAR
alpha
or
AML1/ETO
as
well
as
the
phenotypic
analysis
of
lymphocyte
subsets
involved
in
antitumor
immunity
.

Eight
patients
in
long-term
(
LT
;
3
to
15
years
)
and
15
patients
in
short-term
(
ST
;
up
to
3
years
)
remission
were
studied
.

Using
the
reverse
transcription-polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
)
assay
,
the
limit
of
detection
was
10
(
-5
)
to
10
(
-6
)
for
PML/RAR
alpha
transcript
and
10
(
-4
)
to
10
(
-5
)
for
the
AML1/ETO
transcript
.

Simultaneously
,
T
lymphocyte
subsets
and
NK
cells
from
the
peripheral
blood
(
PB
)
and
bone
marrow
(
BM
)
were
investigated
by
flow
cytometric
analysis
.

Four
of
the
eight
patients
in
LT
and
7
of
the
15
patients
in
ST
remission
were
MRD-positive
.

Although
all
MRD-positive
patients
in
LT
remission
are
still
until
now
event-free
,
3
of
the
7
MRD-positive
(
MRD+
)
patients
in
ST
remission
soon
relapsed
.

The
total
populations
of
CD4
+
,
CD8
+
and
CD56
+
[
possible
T-cell
and
natural
killer
(
T/NK
)
populations
]
in
the
BM
of
ST
patients
and
MRD+/LT
patients
were
significantly
(
p
<
.01
)
low
.

The
CD8+
CD28+
population
showed
the
same
tendency
(
p
<
.01-.02
)
.

The
T/NK
subsets
in
the
BM
of
MRD-negative
(
MRD-
)
LT
(
MRD-/LT
)
patients
showed
similar
numbers
of
cells
as
normal
volunteers
.

Basically
,
the
total
percentage
of
the
CD4+
,
CD8+
and
CD56+
cell
populations
in
the
BM
was
increased
and
in
the
following
order
:
MRD-/LT
patients
,
normal
volunteers
,
MRD+/LT
patients
and
MRD+
or
-/ST
patients
.

The
percentages
of
the
T/NK-cell
subsets
in
the
PB
were
not
significantly
different
among
these
groups
.

Thus
,
the
difference
of
the
possible
T/NK-cell
phenotype
in
the
BM
may
strongly
influence
clinical
and
molecular
remission
.

These
results
still
remain
to
be
confirmed
by
further
studies
of
the
functional
anti-tumor
immunity
of
T/NK
cells
of
AML
in
remission
.

Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
mannose-capped
lipoarabinomannan
can
induce
NF-kappaB
-dependent
activation
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
long
terminal
repeat
in
T
cells
.

Tuberculosis
has
emerged
as
an
epidemic
,
extended
by
the
large
number
of
individuals
infected
with
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
.

The
major
goal
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
the
mycobacterial
cell
wall
component
mannose-capped
lipoarabinomannan
(
ManLAM
)
of
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
(
M.
tuberculosis
)
could
activate
transcription
of
HIV-1
in
T
cells
with
the
use
of
an
in
vitro
cell
culture
system
.

These
experiments
are
of
prime
importance
considering
that
CD4
-expressing
T
lymphocytes
represent
the
major
virus
reservoir
in
the
peripheral
blood
of
infected
individuals
.

Using
the
1G5
cell
line
harbouring
the
luciferase
reporter
gene
under
the
control
of
the
HIV-1
LTR
,
it
was
first
found
that
culture
protein
filtrates
(
CFP
)
from
M.
tuberculosis
or
purified
ManLAM
could
activate
HIV-1
LTR-dependent
gene
expression
unlike
similarly
prepared
CFP
extracts
devoid
of
ManLAM
.

The
implication
of
protein
tyrosine
kinase
(
s
)
,
protein
kinase
A
and/or
protein
kinase
C
was
highlighted
by
the
abrogation
of
the
ManLAM-mediated
activation
of
HIV-1
LTR-driven
gene
expression
using
herbimycin
A
and
H7
.

It
was
also
determined
,
using
electrophoresis
mobility
shift
assays
,
that
M.
tuberculosis
ManLAM
led
to
the
nuclear
translocation
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappaB
.

M.
tuberculosis
ManLAM
resulted
in
clear
induction
of
the
luciferase
gene
placed
under
the
control
of
the
wild-type
,
but
not
the
kappaB-mutated
,
HIV-1
LTR
region
.

Finally
,
the
ManLAM-mediated
activation
of
HIV-1
LTR
transcription
was
found
to
be
independent
of
the
autocrine
or
paracrine
action
of
endogenous
TNF-alpha
.

The
results
suggest
that
M.
tuberculosis
can
upregulate
HIV-1
expression
in
T
cells
and
could
thus
have
the
potential
to
influence
the
pathogenesis
of
HIV-1
infection
.

Human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
long
terminal
repeat
quasispecies
differ
in
basal
transcription
and
nuclear
factor
recruitment
in
human
glial
cells
and
lymphocytes
.

The
generation
of
genomic
diversity
during
the
course
of
infection
has
the
potential
to
affect
all
aspects
of
HIV-1
replication
,
including
expression
of
the
proviral
genome
.

To
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
impact
of
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
sequence
diversity
on
LTR-directed
gene
expression
in
cells
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
and
immune
system
,
we
amplified
and
cloned
LTRs
from
proviral
DNA
in
HIV-1-infected
peripheral
blood
.

Sequence
analysis
of
nineteen
LTRs
cloned
from
2
adult
and
3
pediatric
patients
revealed
an
average
of
33
nucleotide
changes
(
with
respect
to
the
sequence
of
the
LAI
LTR
)
within
the
455-bp
U3
region
.

Transient
expression
analyses
in
cells
of
neuroglial
and
lymphocytic
origin
demonstrated
that
some
of
these
LTRs
had
activities
which
varied
significantly
from
the
LAI
LTR
in
U-373
MG
cells
(
an
astrocytoma
cell
line
)
as
well
as
in
Jurkat
cells
(
a
CD4-positive
lymphocyte
cell
line
)
.

While
LTRs
which
demonstrated
the
highest
activities
in
U-373
MG
cells
also
yielded
high
activities
in
Jurkat
cells
,
the
LTRs
were
generally
more
active
in
Jurkat
cells
when
compared
to
the
LAI
LTR
.

Differences
in
LTR
sequence
also
resulted
in
differences
in
transcription
factor
recruitment
to
cis-acting
sites
within
the
U3
region
of
the
LTR
,
as
demonstrated
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
.

In
particular
,
naturally
occurring
sequence
variation
impacted
transcription
factor
binding
to
an
activating
transcription
factor
/
cAMP
response
element
binding
(
ATF
/
CREB
)
binding
site
(
located
between
the
LEF-1
and
distal
NF-kappaB
transcription
factor
binding
sites
)
that
we
identified
in
previous
studies
of
the
HIV-1
LTR
.

These
findings
suggest
that
LTR
sequence
changes
can
significantly
affect
basal
LTR
function
and
transcription
factor
recruitment
,
which
may
,
in
turn
,
alter
the
course
of
viral
replication
in
cells
of
CNS
and
immune
system
origin
.

HMG
box
containing
transcription
factors
in
lymphocyte
differentiation
.

The
identification
of
the
mammalian
sex-determining
gene
Sry
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
large
family
of
related
(
'
HMG
box
'
)
transcription
factors
that
control
developmental
events
in
yeast
,
C.
elegans
,
Drosophila
and
vertebrates
.

In
lymphocyte
differentiation
,
several
HMG
box
proteins
play
a
decisive
role
.

Sox-4
is
important
for
very
early
B-cell
differentiation
,
while
TCF-1
/
LEF-1
play
a
crucial
role
in
early
thymocyte
development
.

TCF/LEF
proteins
have
recently
been
found
to
constitute
a
downstream
component
of
the
Wingless/Wnt
signal
transduction
pathway
.

In
flies
,
this
pathway
controls
segment
polarity
;
in
Xenopus
it
controls
the
definition
of
the
body
axis
.

Deregulation
of
the
pathway
occurs
in
several
human
tumors
.

These
insights
in
the
molecular
events
that
are
involved
in
TCF/LEF
function
in
these
organisms
may
eventually
lead
to
the
understanding
of
the
function
of
these
HMG
box
proteins
in
lymphoid
development

Transcriptional
regulation
by
C/EBP
alpha
and
-beta
in
the
expression
of
the
gene
for
the
MRP14
myeloid
calcium
binding
protein
.

Transcriptional
regulation
of
the
gene
for
the
myeloid
calcium
binding
protein
,
MRP14
,
was
investigated
in
human
monocytic
leukemia
cell
lines
.

The
MRP14
gene
was
not
expressed
in
monoblastic
ML-1
cells
,
promonocytic
U-937
cells
,
or
promyelocytic
HL-60
cells
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
gene
was
expressed
in
monocytic
THP-1
cells
and
in
the
HL-60
cells
treated
with
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
VD3
)
.

The
level
of
MRP14
in
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
was
two-fold
higher
than
that
in
THP-1
cells
.

Among
several
known
transcription
factor
binding
motifs
,
nuclear
protein
(
s
)
of
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
and
THP-1
cells
bound
to
the
CCAAT/enhancer
binding
protein
(
C/EBP
)
-binding
motif
that
was
located
in
the
upstream
region
of
the
MRP14
gene
(
-81
)
,
as
evidenced
by
the
competitive
gel
mobility-shift
assay
.

An
antibody
for
C/EBP
alpha
super-shifted
the
nucleoprotein
complex
in
THP-1
cells
but
not
in
the
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
,
whereas
an
antibody
for
C/EBP
beta
blocked
the
formation
of
the
complex
with
the
nuclear
factor
of
the
HL-60
cells
but
not
with
that
of
THP-1
cells
.

An
anti-C/EBP
delta
antibody
had
no
effect
on
the
complex
in
either
cell
.

Thus
,
it
was
concluded
that
C/EBP
alpha
and
-beta
were
able
to
bind
to
the
C/EBP
motif
,
and
that
C/EBP
alpha
bound
to
the
motif
in
THP-1
cells
and
C/EBP
beta
bound
to
that
in
the
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
.

Furthermore
,
to
examine
the
transcriptional
activity
of
the
C/EBP
motif
,
we
transfected
several
constructed
luciferase
reporter
DNAs
into
HL-60
cells
and
THP-1
cells
.

The
luciferase
activity
of
the
C/EBP
motif
in
HL-60
cells
was
increased
by
VD3
treatment
.

The
C/EBP
motif
in
the
MRP14
gene
was
confirmed
to
function
as
a
regulatory
region
in
VD3-treated
HL-60
cells
and
THP-1
cells
by
the
assay
.

Since
C/EBP
beta
was
also
detected
in
VD3-untreated
HL-60
cells
by
immunoblotting
,
VD3
activated
C/EBP
beta
to
bind
to
the
motif
,
probably
through
post-translational
modification
.

Patients
with
high-risk
myelodysplastic
syndrome
can
have
polyclonal
or
clonal
haemopoiesis
in
complete
haematological
remission
.

The
clonality
of
mature
peripheral
blood-derived
myeloid
and
lymphoid
cells
and
bone
marrow
haemopoietic
progenitors
from
18
females
with
myelodysplasia
(
MDS
)
(
five
refractory
anaemia
,
RA
;
one
RA
with
ringed
sideroblasts
,
RARS
;
three
chronic
myelomonocytic
leukaemia
,
CMML
;
four
RA
with
excess
of

,
RAEB
;
five
RAEB
in
transformation
,
RAEB-t
)
was
studied
by
X-chromosome
inactivation
analysis
.

Using
the
human
androgen-receptor
(
HUMARA
)
assay
,
we
analysed
the
clonal
patterns
of
highly
purified
immature
CD34+
38-
and
committed
CD34+
38+
marrow-derived
progenitors
,
and
CD16+
14-
granulocytes
,
CD14+
monocytes
,
CD3+
T
and
CD19+
B
lymphocytes
from
peripheral
blood
.

In
high-risk
patients
(
RAEB
,
RAEB-t
)
,
clonality
analysis
was
performed
before
and
after
intensive
remission-induction
treatment
.

All
patients
,
except
one
with
RA
,
had
predominance
of
a
single
clone
in
their
granulocytes
and
monocytes
.

The
same
clonal
pattern
was
found
in
CD34+
progenitor
cells
.

In
contrast
,
CD3+
T
lymphocytes
were
polyclonal
or
oligoclonal
in
14/18
patients
.

X-chromosome
inactivation
patterns
of
CD19+
B
cells
were
highly
concordant
with
CD3+
T
cells
except
for
two
patients
(
one
RA
,
one
CMML
)
with
monoclonal
B
and
polyclonal
T
lymphocytes
,
therefore
suggesting
a
clonal
mutation
in
a
progenitor
common
to
the
myeloid
and
B-lymphoid
lineages
or
the
coexistence
of
MDS
and
a
B-cell
disorder
in
these
particular
patients
.

After
high-dose
non-myeloablative
chemotherapy
,
polyclonal
haemopoiesis
was
reinstalled
in
the
mature
myeloid
cells
and
immature
and
committed
marrow
progenitors
in
three
of
four
patients
achieving
complete
haematological
remission
.

Therefore
we
conclude
that
most
haematological
remissions
in
MDS
are
associated
with
restoration
of
polyclonal
haemopoiesis
.

Prominent
sex
steroid
metabolism
in
human
lymphocytes
.

Steroid
metabolism
was
investigated
in
cultured
human
B-lymphoblastoid
cells
(
B-LCL
)
,
and
peripheral
blood
T
and
B
cells
.

Gene
expression
was
examined
by
reverse-transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
amplification
(
RT-PCR
)
.

Appropriate
sized
transcripts
were
detected
in
both
cultured
and
fresh
peripheral
lymphocytes
for
CYP11A
,
CYP17
,
HSD11L
(
11beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
I
)
,
HSD17B1
(
17beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
type
I
)
and
SRD5A1
(
5alpha-reductase
I
)
.

B-LCL
,
but
not
T
and
B
cells
,
expressed
CYP11B
.

There
was
minimal
expression
of
HSD3B1
and
HSD3B2
(
3beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
I
and
II
)
in
B-LCL
and
T
cells
.

Transcripts
for
CYP19
and
HSD11K
were
not
detected
.

Corresponding
enzymatic
activity
was
detectable
only
for
17-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase
and
5alpha-reductase
,
respectively
producing
testosterone
and
5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
.

Steroid
identities
were
confirmed
by
gas
chromatography/mass
spectrometry
(
GC/MS
)
.

One
metabolite
thought
to
be
deoxycorticosterone
was
identified
by
GC/MS
as
6alpha-hydroxypregnanolone
.

It
was
concluded
that
sex
hormone
metabolism
,
including
androgen
synthesis
,
occurs
in
lymphocytes
,
and
may
modulate
immune
response
.

Human
white
blood
cells
and
hair
follicles
are
good
sources
of
mRNA
for
the
pterin
carbinolamine
dehydratase/dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
for
mutation
detection
.

Pterin
carbinolamine
dehydratase/dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
(
PCD/DCoH
)
is
a
protein
that
has
a
dual
function
.

It
is
a
pterin
4alpha-carbinolamine
dehydratase
that
is
involved
in
the
regeneration
of
the
cofactor
tetrahydrobiopterin
during
the
phenylalanine
hydroxylase-
catalyzed
hydroxylation
of
phenylalanine
.

In
addition
,
it
is
the
dimerization
cofactor
of
HNF1
that
is
able
to
activate
the
transcriptional
activity
of
HNF1
.

Deficiencies
in
the
gene
for
this
dual
functional
protein
result
in
hyperphenylalaninemia
.

Here
we
report
for
the
first
time
that
the
PCD/DCoH
mRNA
is
present
in
human
white
blood
cells
and
hair
follicles
.

Taking
advantage
of
this
finding
,
a
sensitive
,
rapid
and
convenient
method
for
screening
mutations
occurring
in
the
coding
region
of
this
gene
has
been
described

Biochemical
characterization
of
the
NF-Y

during
B

The
transcription
factor
,
NF-Y
,
plays
a
critical
role
in
tissue-specific

II
gene
transcription
.

In
this
report
the
biochemical
properties
of
the
heterotrimeric
NF-Y
complex
have
been
characterized
during
stage-specific
B-cell
development
,
and
in
several
class
II-

B-cell
lines
,
which
represent
distinct

Arrest
of
B
lymphocyte
terminal
differentiation
by
CD40
signaling
:
mechanism
for
lack
of
antibody-secreting
cells
in
germinal
centers
.

Despite
extensive
research
,
the
role
of
CD40
signaling
in
B
cell
terminal
differentiation
remains
controversial
.

Here
we
show
that
CD40
engagement
arrests
B
cell
differentiation
prior
to
plasma
cell
formation
.

This
arrest
is
manifested
at
a
molecular
level
as
a
reduction
in
mRNA
levels
of
secretory
immunoglobulin
gene
products
such
as
mu
(
s
)
and
J
chain
as
well
as
the
loss
of
the
transcriptional
regulator
BLIMP-1
.

Furthermore
,
the
inhibition
of
B
cell
differentiation
by
CD40
engagement
could
not
be
overcome
by
either
mitogens
or
cytokines
,
but
could
be
reversed
by
antibodies
that
interfere
with
the
CD40
/
gp39
interaction
.

These
data
suggest
that
secretory
immunoglobulin
is
not
produced
by
B
cells
that
are
actively
engaged
by
gp39-expressing
T
cells
.

A
positively
charged
alpha-lipoic
acid
analogue
with
increased
cellular
uptake
and
more
potent
immunomodulatory
activity
.

alpha-Lipoic
acid
(
LA
)
is
taken
up
by
cells
and
reduced
to
its
potent
dithiol
form
,
dihydrolipoate
(
DHLA
)
,
much
of
which
is
rapidly
effluxed
out
from
cells
.

To
improve
retention
in
cells
,
the
LA
molecule
was
modified
to
confer
a
positive
charge
at
physiological
pH
.

N
,
N-dimethyl
,
N'-2-amidoethyl-lipoate
was
synthesized
.

The
protonated
form
of
the
new
molecule
is
referred
to
as
LA-Plus
.

The
uptake
of
LA-Plus
by
human
Wurzburg
T
cells
was
higher
compared
to
that
of
LA
.

Several-fold
higher
amounts
of
DHLA-Plus
,
the
corresponding
reduced
form
of
LA-Plus
,
were
detected
in
LA-Plus
treated
cells
compared
to
the
amount
of
DHLA
found
in
cells
treated
with
LA
.

At
100
microM
,
LA
did
not
but
LA-Plus
inhibited
H2O2
induced
NF-kappaB
activation
and
NF-kappaB
directed
IL-2
receptor
expression
.

Both
LA
and
LA-Plus
synergised
with
selenium
in
inhibiting
H2O2
induced
NF-kappaB
activation
.

At
150
microM
LA-Plus
,
but
not
LA
,
inhibited
TNFalpha
induced
NF-kappaB
activation
.

At
5
microM
LA-Plus
,
but
not
LA
,
protected
against
both
spontaneous
and
etoposide
induced
apoptosis
in
rat
thymocytes
.

LA-Plus
is
thus
an
improved
form
of
LA
with
increased
therapeutic
potential
.

Carrier
identification
in
X-linked
immunodeficiency
diseases
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Carrier
identification
in
X-linked
immunodeficiency
disorders
can
be
based
on
the
demonstration
of
non-random
X
inactivation
(
NRXI
)
in
affected
blood
cell
lineages
when
growth
is
impaired
in
cells
expressing
the
abnormal
gene
.

We
examined
the
utility
of
seeking
evidence
of
NRXI
to
test
the
carrier
status
of
women
in
families
affected
by
X-linked
severe
combined
immunodeficiency
(
XSCID
)
and
X-linked
hypogammaglobulinaemia
(
XLH
)
,
to
identify
as
carriers
the
mothers
of
boys
with
SCID
or
hypogammaglobulinaemia
whose
phenotype
suggested
X-linkage
and
to
infer
X-linkage
in
boys
with
SCID
or
hypogammaglobulinaemia
whose
disease
was
not
clearly
X-linked
on
the
basis
either
of
family
history
or
clinical
and
immunological
characteristics
.

METHODOLOGY
:
A
polymerase
chain
reaction-based
method
was
used
to
amplify
a
polymorphic
CAG
repeat
in
the
first
exon
of
the
androgen
receptor
gene
after
selective
digestion
of
the
active
X
chromosome
with
a
methylation-sensitive
enzyme
,
HpaII
to
distinguish
between
the
paternal
and
maternal
alleles
and
to
identify
their
methylation
status
.

RESULTS
:
Heterozygosity
was
found
in
24
of
31
female
subjects
(
77
%
)
.

As
anticipated
,
NRXI
could
be
demonstrated
in
all
lymphoid
cells
studied
from
obligate
carriers
of
XSCID
and
an
obligate
carrier
of
XLH
but
not
on
a
carrier
of
X-linked
immunodeficiency
with
hyper-IgM
.

The
finding
of
NRXI
in
the
mother
of
a
boy
with
a
SCID
variant
showed
her
to
be
a
carrier
of
XSCID
and
establishes
that
her
son
has
XSCID
,
not
otherwise
evident
from
available
data
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
This
PCR
assay
provides
a
rapid
method
for
carrier
detection
of
X-linked
immunodeficiencies
,
and
has
allowed
us
to
expand
the
phenotype
of
XSCID

Leukocyte-endothelial
interaction
is
augmented
by
high
glucose
concentrations
and
hyperglycemia
in
a
NF-kB-dependent
fashion
.

We
addressed
the
role
of
hyperglycemia
in
leukocyte-endothelium
interaction
under
flow
conditions
by
exposing
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
for
24
h
to
normal
(
5
mM
)
,
high
concentration
of
glucose
(
30
mM
)
,
advanced
glycosylation
end
product-albumin
(
100
microg/ml
)
,
or
hyperglycemic
(
174-316
mg/dl
)
sera
from
patients
with
diabetes
and
abnormal
hemoglobin
A1c
(
8.1+/-1.4
%
)
.

At
the
end
of
incubation
endothelial
cells
were
perfused
with
total
leukocyte
suspension
in
a
parallel
plate
flow
chamber
under
laminar
flow
(
1.5
dyn/cm2
)
.

Rolling
and
adherent
cells
were
evaluated
by
digital
image
processing
.

Results
showed
that
30
mM
glucose
significantly
(
P
<
0.01
)
increased
the
number
of
adherent
leukocytes
to
endothelial
cells
in
respect
to
control
(
5
mM
glucose
;
151+/-19
versus
33+/-8
cells/mm2
)
.

A
similar
response
was
induced
by
endothelial
stimulation
with
IL-1beta
,
here
used
as
positive
control
(
195+/-20
cells/mm2
)
.

The
number
of
rolling
cells
on
endothelial
surface
was
not
affected
by
high
glucose
level
.

Stable
adhesion
of
leukocytes
to
glucose-treated
as
well
as
to
IL-1beta-stimulated
endothelial
cells
was
preceded
by
short
interaction
of
leukocytes
with
the
endothelial
surface
.

The
distance
travelled
by
leukocytes
before
arrest
on
30
mM
glucose
,
or
on
IL-1beta-treated
endothelial
cells
,
was
significantly
(
P
<
0.01
)
higher
than
that
observed
for
leukocytes
adhering
on
control
endothelium
(
30
mM
glucose
:
76.7+/-3.5
;
IL1beta
:
69.7+/-4
versus
5
mM
glucose
:
21.5+/-5
microm
)
.

Functional
blocking
of
E-selectin
,
intercellular
cell
adhesion
molecule-1
,
and
vascular
cell

on
endothelial
cells
with
the
corresponding
mouse
mAb
significantly
inhibited
glucose-induced
increase
in
leukocyte
adhesion
(
67+/-16
,
83+/-12
,
62+/-8
versus
144+/-21
cells/
mm2
)
.

Confocal
fluorescence
microscopy
studies
showed
that
30
mM
glucose
induced
an
increase
in
endothelial
surface
expression
of
E-selectin
,
intercellular
cell
adhesion
molecule-1
,
and
vascular
cell
adhesion
molecule-1
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
of
nuclear
extracts
of
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVEC
)
exposed
for
1
h
to
30
mM
glucose
revealed
an
intense
NF-kB
activation
.

Treatment
of
HUVEC
exposed
to
high
glucose
with
the
NF-kB
inhibitors
pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate
(
100
microM
)
and
tosyl-phe-chloromethylketone
(
25
microM
)
significantly
reduced
(
P
<
0.05
)
leukocyte
adhesion
in
respect
to
HUVEC
treated
with
glucose
alone
.

A
significant
(
P
<
0.01
)
inhibitory
effect
on
glucose-induced
leukocyte
adhesion
was
observed
after
blocking
protein
kinase
C
activity
with
staurosporine
(
5
nM
)
.

When
HUVEC
were
treated
with
specific
antisense
oligodesoxynucleotides
against
PKCalpha
and
PKCepsilon
isoforms
before
the
addition
of
30
mM
glucose
,
a
significant
(
P
<
0.05
)
reduction
in
the
adhesion
was
also
seen
.

Advanced
glycosylation
end
product-albumin
significantly
increased
the
number
of
adhering
leukocytes
in
respect
to
native
albumin
used
as
control
(
110+/-16
versus
66+/-7
,
P
<
0.01
)
.

Sera
from
diabetic
patients
significantly
(
P
<
0.01
)
enhanced
leukocyte
adhesion
as
compared
with
controls
,
despite
normal
levels
of
IL-1beta
and
TNFalpha
in
these
sera
.

These
data
indicate
that
high
glucose
concentration
and
hyperglycemia
promote
leukocyte
adhesion
to
the
endothelium
through
upregulation
of
cell
surface
expression
of
adhesive
proteins
,
possibly
depending
on
NF-kB
activation
.

Ikaros
in
hemopoietic
lineage
determination
and
homeostasis
.

Studies
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
control
hemopoietic
differentiation
have
focused
on
signaling
cascades
and
nuclear
effectors
that
drive
this
complex
developmental
system
in
a
regulated
fashion
.

Here
we
review
the
role
of
Ikaros
,
the
founding
member
of
a
unique
family
of
zinc
finger
transcription
factors
in
this
developmental
process
.

Studies
on
an
Ikaros
null
mutation
have
revealed
an
essential
role
for
this
factor
in
lymphoid
cell
fate
determination
and
at
subsequent
branch
points
of
the
T
cell
differentiation
pathway
.

Differences
in
the
phenotypes
of
a
null
and
a
dominant
negative
(
DN
)
Ikaros
mutation
provide
insight
into
a
regulatory
network
through
which
Ikaros
proteins
exert
their
effects
in
development
.

In
addition
a
comparative
analysis
of
the
hemopoietic
stem
cell
and
precursor
compartment
resulting
from
the
two
Ikaros
mutations
reveals
a
profound
yet
not
absolute
requirement
for
Ikaros

Induction
of
early
B
cell
factor
(
EBF
)
and
multiple
B
lineage
genes
by
the
basic
helix-loop-helix
transcription
factor
E12
.

The
transcription
factors
encoded
by
the
E2A
and
early
B
cell
factor
(
EBF
)
genes
are
required
for
the
proper
development
of
B
lymphocytes
.

However
,
the
absence
of
B
lineage
cells
in
E2A-
and
EBF-deficient
mice
has
made
it
difficult
to
determine
the
function
or
relationship
between
these
proteins
.

We
report
the
identification
of
a
novel
model
system
in
which
the
role
of
E2A
and
EBF
in
the
regulation
of
multiple
B
lineage
traits
can
be
studied
.

We
found
that
the
conversion
of
70Z/3
pre-B
lymphocytes
to
cells
with
a
macrophage-like
phenotype
is
associated
with
the
loss
of
E2A
and
EBF
.

Moreover
,
we
show
that
ectopic
expression
of
the
E2A
protein
E12
in
this
macrophage
line
results
in
the
induction
of
many
B
lineage
genes
,
including
EBF
,
IL7Ralpha
,
lambda5
,
and
Rag-1
,
and
the
ability
to
induce
kappa
light
chain
in
response
to
mitogen
.

Activation
of
EBF
may
be
one
of
the
critical
functions
of
E12
in
regulating
the
B
lineage
phenotype
since
expression
of
EBF
alone
leads
to
the
activation
of
a
subset
of
E12
-inducible
traits
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
,
in
the
context
of
this
macrophage
line
,
E12
induces
expression
of
EBF
and
together
these
transcription
factors
coordinately
regulate
numerous
B
lineage-associated
genes
.

Activation-induced
down-regulation
of
retinoid
receptor
RXRalpha
expression
in
human
T
lymphocytes
.

Role
of
cell
cycle
regulation
.

A
5.4-kilobase
mRNA
,
the
expression
of
which
is
down-regulated
after
treatment
of
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
with
various
T
cell-activating
agents
,
was
isolated
using
an
mRNA
differential
display
method
.

Nucleotide
sequence
analysis
identified
the
5
'
end
of
this
RNA
as
human
retinoid
receptor
RXRalpha
mRNA
.

Here
,
we
report
the
nucleotide
sequence
of
3.6
kilobases
of
this
RNA
,
which
represents
the
3
'
end
of
RXRalpha
mRNA
,
the
sequence
of
which
has
not
been
previously
described
.

Activated
PBMCs
also
expressed
lower
levels
of
RXRalpha
protein
,
and
a
DNA
binding
assay
showed
that
the
activation-induced
loss
of
RXRalpha
mRNA
and
protein
expression
correlated
with
the
loss
of
DNA
binding
activity
of
this
protein
.

We
present
evidence
that
the
transition
from
G0/G1
to
S
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
results
in
the
down-regulation
of
RXRalpha
expression
and
that
cell
cycle
inhibitors
,
which
block
the
cells
in
G1
phase
,
prevent
this
down-regulation
.

The
decrease
in
the
levels
of
RXRalpha
mRNA
was
found
to
be
regulated
at
the
post-transcriptional
level
and
involved
new
protein
synthesis
.

These
observations
indicate
that
the
levels
of
RXRalpha
expression
in
T
lymphocytes
are
coupled
to
cell
cycle
progression
,
and
there
is
tight
regulatory
control
of
RXRalpha
expression
during
the
transition
from
G0/G1
to
S
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Epidemiology
and
pathogenesis
of
AIDS-related
lymphomas
.

Among
patients
with
congenital
and
acquired
immunodeficiencies
,
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphoma
(
NHLs
)
are
the
most
common
tumors
of
the
immune
system
.

In
the
setting
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
infection
,
as
many
as
10
%
to
20
%
of
people
ultimately
developed
NHLs
.

These
tumors
are
clinically
aggressive
,
frequently
involve
extranodal
sites
,
and
often
exhibit
unique
features
that
distinguish
them
from
NHL
arising
in
individuals
with
other
forms
of
immunosuppression
.

Important
in
the
development
of
HIV-associated
NHL
are
cytokines
and
other
factors
that
induce
B-cell
proliferation
and
increase
the
likelihood
of
mutations
of
c-myc
,
bcl-6
,
and
other
tumor-suppressor
genes
with
carcinogenic
potential
.

Specific
forms
of
HIV-associated
NHL
are
linked
to
expression
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
-latent
proteins
;
the
newly
described
DNA
virus
,
Karposi
's
sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus/human
herpesvirus-8
(
KSHV/HHV-8
)
;
and
perhaps
HIV
.

Elucidation
of
the
factors
that
contribute
to
the
high
incidence
of
NHL
among
patients
infected
with
HIV
provides
insights
into
important
elements
of
lymphomagenesis
.

)
was
observed
in
about
10
%
of
epithelial
cells
in
the
control
groups
(
cases
of
fibrocystic
and
benign
proliferative
breast
disease
)
,
while
expression
(
>
10
%
of
expression
)
was
detected
in
89.7
%
of
tumours
.

The
expression
of
ST1
in
carcinoma
cells
was
strongly
associated
with
its
presence
in
the
stroma
(
p
<
0.001
)
.

A
significantly
positive
correlation
was
found
between
ST1
expression
,
and
p53
tumour
suppressor
gene
product
(
p
=
0.004
)
,
and
a
relationship
with
c-erbB-2
protein
and
progesterone
receptor
status
was
also
indicated
.

These
findings
suggest
that
ST1
expression
in
breast
cancer
tissue
is
irrespective
of
the
expression
of
the
extracellular
matrix
component
,
the
proteolytic
enzyme
cathepsin
D
and
the
growth
fraction
of
the
tumour
,
and
that
it
could
be
a
potential
new
prognostic
marker
in
breast
cancer
.

Use
of
transfected
liver
cells
to
evaluate
potential
mechanisms
of
alcohol-induced
liver
injury
[
see
comments
]

There
is
increased
activity
of
the
proinflammatory
cytokine
,
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
in
alcoholic
liver
disease
(
ALD
)
.

Hepatic
neutrophil
infiltration
is
a
principal
injurious
manifestation
of
ALD
.

TNF
can
induce
cellular
oxidative
injury
directly
,
and
indirectly
by
inducing
neutrophil
chemotactic
factor
(
IL-8
)
production
by
hepatocytes
.

IL-8
activates
and
chemotactically
attracts
neutrophils
to
the
liver
where
they
release
oxidizing
substances
.

Patients
with
ALD
also
have
decreased
protective
factors
for
cellular
oxidative
injury
.

Manganous
superoxide
dismutase
(
MnSOD
)
is
an
antioxidant
protective
factor
.

The
objectives
of
these
studies
were
to
investigate
mechanisms
for
induction
of
an
injurious
factor
(
IL-8
)
and
a
protective
factor
(
MnSOD
)
in
the
HepG2
human
hepatoma
cell
line
.

In
the
first
set
of
experiments
,
IL-8
gene
reporter
constructs
were
used
to
transiently
transfect
a
derivative
(
MVh2E1-9
)
of
the
HepG2
cell
line
which
expresses
P-4502E1
and
metabolizes
ethanol
.

Inactivation
of
the
NF-kappaB
and
3'NF-IL-6
DNA
binding
sites
decreased
IL-8
gene
transcriptional
activation
in
response
to
TNF
while
inactivation
of
the
5'NF-IL-6
binding
site
increased
IL-8
gene
transcriptional
activity
in
response
to
TNF
.

This
system
may
be
useful
to
assess
the
effects
of
ethanol
on
TNF
-induced
hepatocyte
IL-8
production
.

In
the
second
set
of
experiments
,
HepG2
cells
were
cultured
in
25
to
100
mmol
concentrations
of
ethanol
.

Both
TNF
and
ethanol
increased
HepG2
cell
MnSOD
activity
in
short-term
(
72
hr
)
cultures
with
ethanol
.

However
,
after
long-term
(
10
weeks
)
culture
with
ethanol
,
there
was
no
induction
of
MnSOD
by
ethanol
and
there
was
a
diminished
induction
of
MnSOD
in
response
to
TNF
.

Further
studies
are
needed
to
assess
the
effect
of
this
diminished
induction
of
MnSOD
with
chronic
ethanol
culture
on
HepG2
cell
susceptibility
to
TNF
cytotoxicity
.

We
conclude
that
transfected
liver
cell
lines
can
be
used
to
evaluate
mechanisms
for
increased
injurious
factors
and
decreased
protective
factors
in
alcoholic
liver
injury
.

Tissue
factor
transcription
driven
by
Egr-1
is
a
critical
mechanism
of
murine
pulmonary
fibrin
deposition
in
hypoxia
.

Local
hypoxemia
and
stasis
trigger
thrombosis
.

We
have
demonstrated
previously
that
in
a
murine
model
of
normobaric
hypoxia
pulmonary
fibrin
deposition
is
a
result
of
expression
of
tissue
factor
,
especially
in
oxygen-deprived
mononuclear
phagocytes
(
MPs
)
.

We
now
show
that
transcription
factor
early-growth-response
gene
product
(
Egr-1
)
is
rapidly
activated
in
hypoxia
,
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
and
is
responsible
for
transcription
and
expression
of
tissue
factor
in
hypoxic
lung
.

MPs
and
HeLa
cells
subjected
to
hypoxia
(
pO2
approximately
13
torr
)
had
increased
levels
of
tissue
factor
transcripts
(
approximately
18-fold
)
and
an
increased
rate
of
transcription
(
approximately
15-fold
)
,
based
on
nuclear
run-on
analysis
.

Gel-shift
analysis
of
nuclear
extracts
from
hypoxic
MPs
and
HeLa
cells
demonstrated
increased
DNA-binding
activity
at
the
serum
response
region
(
SRR
;
-111/+14
bp
)
of
the
tissue
factor
promoter
at
Egr-1
motifs
.

Using
32P-labeled
Egr
consensus
oligonucleotide
,
we
observed
induction
of
DNA-binding
activity
in
nuclear
extracts
from
hypoxic
lung
and
HeLa
cells
because
of
activation
of
Egr-1
,
by
means
of
supershift
analysis
.

Transient
transfection
of
HeLa
cells
with
chimeric
plasmids
containing
wild-type
or
mutant
SRR
from
the
tissue
factor
promoter
showed
that
intact
Sp1
sites
are
necessary
for
basal
promoter
activity
,
whereas
the
integrity
of
Egr-1
sites
was
required
for
hypoxia-enhanced
expression
.

A
central
role
for
Egr-1
in
hypoxia-mediated
tissue
factor
expression
was
confirmed
by
experiments
with
homozygous
Egr-1
null
mice
;
wild-type
mice
subjected
to
oxygen
deprivation
expressed
tissue
factor
and
showed
fibrin
deposition
,
but
hypoxic
homozygous
Egr-1
null
mice
displayed
neither
tissue
factor
nor
fibrin
.

These
data
delineate
a
novel
biology
for
hypoxia-induced
fibrin
deposition
,
in
which
oxygen
deprivation-induced
activation
of
Egr-1
,
resulting
in
expression
of
tissue
factor
,
has
an
unexpected
and
central
role
.

Kinetics
of
cytokine
and
NFAT
gene
expression
in
human
interleukin-2-dependent
T
lymphoblasts
stimulated
via
T-cell
receptor
.

T
cells
respond
to
mitogenic
or
antigenic
stimulation
by
proliferation
and
by
turning
on
cytokine
gene
expression
.

Here
we
have
analysed
the
kinetics
and
nature
of
cytokine
production
in
human
peripheral
blood-derived
T
lymphoblasts
stimulated
with
anti-CD3
antibodies
or
Lens
culinaris
lectin
(
LCL
)
.

T
cells
were
purified
from
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
and
primarily
activated
with
anti-CD3
antibodies
and
cultured
in
the
presence
of
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
.

Anti-CD3-restimulated
T
cells
(
mainly
CD8+
)
produced
IL-2
,
interferon-gamma
(
IFN-gamma
)
and
tumour
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
and
low
levels
of
IL-4
and
IL-10
transcripts
and
proteins
.

No
IL-6
gene
expression
was
observed
.

In
LCL-stimulated
cells
the
cytokine
production
pattern
was
very
similar
.

Steady-state
mRNA
levels
of
IL-2
,
IL-10
and
IFN-gamma
peaked
at
3
hr
after
anti-CD3
stimulation
and
declined
rapidly
thereafter
.

The
kinetics
of
TNF-alpha
mRNA
expression
was
faster
,
being
at
its
peak
level
1
hr
after
stimulation
.

Anti-CD3-stimulated
IL-2
gene
expression
was
down-regulated
by
protein
synthesis
inhibitor
,
whereas
IL-10
,
IFN-gamma
and
TNF-alpha
genes
were
readily
induced
independent
of
ongoing
protein
synthesis
.

T-cell
receptor
stimulation
also
induced
a
very
rapid
expression
of
c-jun
,
c-fos
and
NFATc1
(
NFATc
)
genes
,
the
gene
products
of
which
are
involved
in
cytokine
gene
expression
.

In
conclusion
,
the
cytokines
synthesized
by
IL-2-dependent
T
cells
were
predominantly
IL-2
,
IFN-gamma
and
TNF-alpha
.

An
animal
model
to
study
local
oxidation
of
LDL
and
its
biological
effects
in
the
arterial
wall
.

Oxidized
LDL
(
oxLDL
)
is
present
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
and
is
believed
to
play
a
key
role
in
atherogenesis
.

Mainly
on
the
basis
of
cell
culture
studies
,
oxLDL
has
been
shown
to
produce
many
biological
effects
that
influence
the
atherosclerotic
process
.

To
study
LDL
oxidation
in
vivo
,
we
have
established
a
model
in
which
Sprague-Dawley
rats
are
given
a
single
injection
of
unmodified
human
LDL
(
>
or
=
4
mg/kg
body
weight
)
.

Within
6
hours
,
an
accumulation
of
apolipoprotein
B
and
epitopes
present
on
oxLDL
are
detected
in
the
arterial
endothelium
and
media
.

The
presence
of
oxLDL
is
associated
with
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappaB
in
the
endothelium
as
well
as
endothelial
expression
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
.

Injection
of
LDL
enriched
with
the
antioxidant
probucol
resulted
in
arterial
accumulation
of
apolipoprotein
B
,
but
the
expression
of
oxLDL-specific
epitopes
was
reduced
at
24
hours
.

Thus
,
this
simple
model
has
the
potential
to
analyze
the
mechanisms
behind
and
biological
effects
of
LDL
oxidation
in
vivo
.

Molecular
mechanisms
of
promoter
regulation
of
the
gp34
gene
that
is
trans-activated
by
an
oncoprotein
Tax
of
human
T
cell
leukemia
virus
type
I
.

We
investigated
the
molecular
mechanism
of
transcriptional
activation
of
the
gp34
gene
by
the
Tax
oncoprotein
of
human
T
cell
leukemia
virus
type
I
(
HTLV-I
)
.

gp34
is
a
type
II
transmembrane
molecule
belonging
to
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
family
and
is
constitutively
expressed
on
HTLV-I-producing
cells
but
not
normal
resting
T
cells
.

The
transcriptional
regulatory
region
of
the
gp34
gene
was
activated
by
HTLV-I
Tax
in
the
human
T
cell
line
Jurkat
,
in
which
endogenous
gp34
is
induced
by
Tax
.

Sequence
analysis
demonstrated
that
two
NF-kappaB-like
elements
(
1
and
2
)
were
present
in
the
regulatory
region
.

Both
NF-kappaB-like
elements
were
able
to
bind
to
NF-kappaB
or
its
related
factor
(
s
)
in
a
Tax
-dependent
manner
.

Chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
assays
indicated
that
NF-kappaB-like
element
1
was
Tax
-responsive
,
although
the
activity
was
lower
than
that
the
native
promoter
.

NF-kappaB
-like
element
2
elevated
promoter
activity
when
combined
with
NF-kappaB-like
element
1
,
indicating
cooperative
function
of
the
elements
for
maximum
promoter
function
.

Unlike
typical
NF-kappaB
elements
,
the
NF-kappaB-like
elements
in
gp34
were
not
activated
by
treatment
of
Jurkat
cells
with
phorbol
ester
despite
induction
of
the
NF-kappaB
-like
binding
activity
.

Chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
reporter
assays
using
the
region
upstream
of
the
NF-kappaB-like
elements
identified
an
upstream
region
that
reduced
transcription
from
cognate
and
noncognate
core
promoters
in
a
Tax-independent
manner
.

Our
results
imply
complex
regulation
of
expression
of
the
gp34
gene
and
suggest
implication
of
gp34
in
proliferation
of
HTLV-I
infected
T
cells
.

beta-Amyloid
fibrils
activate
parallel
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
pathways
in
microglia
and
THP1
monocytes
.

The
senile
plaques
of
Alzheimer
's
disease
are
foci
of
local
inflammatory
responses
,
as
evidenced
by
the
presence
of
acute
phase
proteins
and
oxidative
damage
.

Fibrillar
forms
of
beta-amyloid
(
Abeta
)
,
which
are
the
primary
constituents
of
senile
plaques
,
have
been
shown
to
activate
tyrosine
kinase-dependent
signal
transduction
cascades
,
resulting
in
inflammatory
responses
in
microglia
.

However
,
the
downstream
signaling
pathways
mediating
Abeta
-induced
inflammatory
events
are
not
well
characterized
.

We
report
that
exposure
of
primary
rat
microglia
and
human
THP1
monocytes
to
fibrillar
Abeta
results
in
the
tyrosine
kinase
-dependent
activation
of
two
parallel
signal
transduction
cascades
involving
members
of
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
superfamily
.

Abeta
stimulated
the
rapid
,
transient
activation
of
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
1
(
ERK1
)
and
ERK2
in
microglia
and
ERK2
in
THP1
monocytes
.

A
second
superfamily
member
,
p38
MAPK
,
was
also
activated
with
similar
kinetics
.

Scavenger
receptor
and
receptor
for
advanced
glycated
end
products
(
RAGE
)
ligands
failed
to
activate
ERK
and
p38
MAPK
in
the
absence
of
significant
increases
in
protein
tyrosine
phosphorylation
,
demonstrating
that
scavenger
receptors
and
RAGE
are
not
linked
to
these
pathways
.

Importantly
,
the
stress-activated
protein
kinases
(
SAPKs
)
were
not
significantly
activated
in
response
to
Abeta
.

Downstream
effectors
of
the
MAPK
signal
transduction
cascades
include
MAPKAP
kinases
,
such
as
RSK1
and
RSK2
,
as
well
as
transcription
factors
.

Exposure
of
microglia
and
THP1
monocytes
to
Abeta
resulted
in
the
activation
of
RSK1
and
RSK2
and
phosphorylation
of
cAMP
response
element-binding
protein
at
Ser133
,
providing
a
mechanism
for
Abeta
-induced
changes
in

expression

Regulation
of
cellular
retinoic
acid
binding
protein
(
CRABP
II
)
during
human
monocyte
differentiation
in
vitro
.

Cellular
retinoic
acid
binding
proteins
(
CRABP
)
are
low
molecular
weight
proteins
whose
precise
function
remains
unknown
.

They
bind
retinoids
and
may
thereby
modulate
the
intracellular
steady-state
concentration
of
retinoids
.

Whereas
CRABP
I
is
ubiquitously
expressed
,
CRABP
II
is
mainly
detected
in
various
cell
types
of
the
skin
.

By
representative
difference
analysis
we
found
that
CRABP
II
is
also
strongly
expressed
in
human
monocyte-derived
macrophages
(
MAC
)
but
not
in
freshly
isolated
monocytes
(
MO
)
.

The
CRABP
II
mRNA
was
gradually
upregulated
during
differentiation
from
MO
to
MAC
in
the
presence
of
2
%
serum
.

Adherence
,
which
is
important
for
MO
differentiation
,
induced
CRABP
II
expression
,
but
the
addition
of
10
(
-7
)
M
retinoic
acid
inhibited
the
upregulation
of
CRABP
II
expression
during
MO/MAC
differentiation
.

As
MO
can
differentiate
along
the
classical
pathway
not
only
to
MAC
but
also
to
dendritic
cells
we
analyzed
the
expression
of
CRABP
II
in
MO-derived
dendritic
cells
cultured
with
10
%
FCS
,
IL-4
,
and
GM-CSF
.

In
contrast
to
MAC
,
MO-derived
dendritic
cells
showed
an
extremely
low
expression
of
CRABP
II
.

From
these
results
we
conclude
(
1
)
that
the
availability
and
the
metabolism
of
retinoids
may
be
different
in
MAC
compared
to
MO
and
dendritic
cells
and
(
2
)
that
this
may
influence
differentiation
and
activation
of
those
cells
.

Transcription
factor
B-cell-specific
activator
protein
(
BSAP
)
is
differentially
expressed
in
B
cells
and
in
subsets
of
B-cell
lymphomas
.

The
paired
box
containing
gene
PAX-5
encodes
the
transcription
factor
BSAP
(
B-cell-specific
activator
protein
)
,
which
plays
a
key
role
in
B-lymphocyte
development
.

Despite
its
known
involvement
in
a
rare
subtype
of
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphoma
(
NHL
)
,
a
detailed
examination
of
BSAP
expression
in
NHL
has
not
been
previously
reported
.

In
this
study
,
we
analyzed
normal
and
malignant
lymphoid
tissues
and
cell
lines
,
including
102
cases
of
B-cell
NHL
,
23
cases
of
T-
and
null-cell
NHL
,
and
18
cases
of
Hodgkin
's
disease
.

Normal
lymphoid
tissues
showed
strong
nuclear
BSAP
expression
in
mantle
zone
B
cells
,
less
intense
reactivity
in
follicular
center
B
cells
,
and
no
expression
in
cells
of
the
T-cell-rich
zones
.

Monocytoid
B
cells
showed
weak
expression
,
whereas
plasma
cells
and
extrafollicular
large
transformed
B
cells
were
negative
.

Of
the
102
B-cell
NHLs
,
83
(
81
%
)
demonstrated
BSAP
expression
.

All
of
the
13
(
100
%
)
B-cell
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemias
(
B-CLLs
)
,
21
of
(
100
%
)
mantle
cells
(
MCLs
)
,
and
20
of
21
(
95
%
)
follicular
lymphomas
(
FLs
)
were
positive
.

Moderate
staining
intensities
were
found
in
most
B-CLL
and
FL
cases
,
whereas
most
MCLs
showed
strong
reactions
,
paralleling
the
strong
reactivity
of
nonmalignant
mantle
cells
.

Eight
of
12
(
67
%
)
marginal
zone
lymphoma
cases
showed
negative
or
low
BSAP
levels
,
and
17
of
24
(
71
%
)
large
B-cell
lymphomas
displayed
moderate
to
strong
expression
.

None
of
the
23
T-
and
null-cell
lymphomas
reacted
with
the
BSAP
antisera
,
whereas
in
Hodgkin
's
disease
,
2
of
4
(
50
%
)
nodular
lymphocytic
predominance
and
5
of
14
(
36
%
)
classical
cases
showed
weak
nuclear
or
nucleolar
BSAP
reactions
in
a
fraction
of
the
tumor
cells
.

Western
blot
analysis
showed

We
conclude
that
BSAP

largely
restricted

lineage
and
that
BSAP
expression
varies
in
B-cell

The
high
levels
of
BSAP
,
especially
those
found
in
large-cell
lymphomas
and
in
some
follicular
lymphomas
,
may
be
a
consequence
of
deregulated
gene
expression

suggest
a
possible

of
PAX-5

Mitogen
and
growth
factor-induced
activation
of
a
STAT-like
molecule
in
channel
catfish
lymphoid
cells
.

This
article
describes
the
identification
of
a
putative
STAT
molecule
in
the
channel
catfish
(
Ictalurus
punctatus
)
,
the
first
report
of
such
a
molecule
in
a
'lower
'
vertebrate
.

A
monoclonal
antibody
against
human
STAT6
recognizes
an
approximately
100
kDa
molecule
that
becomes
activated
and
translocates
to
the
nucleus
upon
both
growth
factor
and
mitogen
stimulation
of
catfish
leukocytes
.

This
presumed
catfish
STAT
binds
the
mammalian
interferon-gamma
activation
site
,
a
known
motif
of
mammalian
STAT
binding
,
as
shown
by
electromobility
shift
assays
.

Purification
of
the
proteins
present
in
these
DNA
complexes
confirms
that
the
catfish
reactive
molecule
binds
to
the
interferon-gamma
activation
site
sequence
.

These
results
suggest
that
STAT
molecules
have
been
highly
conserved
in
vertebrate
evolution
.

Isolation
and
analysis
of
a
T
cell
clone
variant
exhibiting
constitutively
phosphorylated
Ser133
cAMP
response
element-binding
protein
.

In
driving
T
cell
proliferation
,
IL-2
stimulates
a
new
program
of
gene
expression
that
includes
proliferating
cell
nuclear
antigen
(
PCNA
)
,
a
requisite
processivity
factor
for
DNA
polymerase
delta
.

PCNA
transcription
is
regulated
in
part
through
tandem
CRE
sequences
in
the
promoter
and
CRE
binding
proteins
;
IL-2
stimulates
CREB
phosphorylation
in
the
resting
cloned
T
lymphocyte
,
L2
.

After
culturing
L2
cells
for
greater
than
91
days
,
we
consistently
isolate
a
stable
variant
that
exhibits
constitutive
CREB
phosphorylation
.

L2
and
L2
variant
cells
were
tested
for
IL-2
responsiveness
and
rapamycin
sensitivity
with
respect
to
specific
kinase
activity
,
PCNA
expression
and
proliferation
.

In
L2
cells
,
IL-2
stimulated
and
rapamycin
inhibited
the
following
:
cAMP-independent
CREB
kinase
activity
,
PCNA
expression
and
proliferation
.

In
L2
variant
cells
,
CREB
kinase
activity
was
constitutively
high
;
IL-2
stimulated
and
rapamycin
blocked
PCNA
expression
and
proliferation
.

These
results
indicate
that
IL-2
induces
a
rapamycin-sensitive
,
cAMP-independent
CREB
kinase
activity
in
L2
cells
.

However
,
phosphorylation
of
CREB
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
drive
PCNA
expression
and
L2
cell
proliferation
in
the
absence
of
IL-2
.

Serotonin
derivative
,
N-
(
p-coumaroyl
)
serotonin
,
inhibits
the
production
of
TNF-alpha
,
IL-1alpha
,
IL-1beta
,
and
IL-6
by
endotoxin-stimulated
human
blood
monocytes
.

We
have
reported
that
N-
(
p-coumaroyl
)
serotonin
(
CS
)
and
its
derivatives
with
antioxidative
activity
are
present
in
safflower
seeds
.

As
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
are
implicated
in
the
signaling
of
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
,
we
examined
whether
CS
has
a
suppressive
effect
on
inflammatory
cytokine
generation
from
human
monocyte
s
in
vitro
.

CS
at
50-200
microM
reduced
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
,
interleukin-1
(
IL-1
)
,
and
IL-6
activities
in
the
culture
supernatants
from
LPS-stimulated
human
blood
monocytes
without
cytotoxicity
.

ELISA
assay
revealed
that
the
production
of
TNF-alpha
,
IL-1alpha
,
IL-1beta
,
and
IL-6
was
inhibited
by
CS
.

Northern
blot
analysis
showed
that
LPS-induced
expression
of
these
cytokine
mRNA
in
monocytes
was
suppressed
by
CS
.

NF-kappaB
activation
was
also
inhibited
by
CS
.

These
findings
indicate
that
CS
has
a
suppressive
effect
on
proinflammatory
cytokine
production
from
monocytes
,
and
this
effect
is
based
in
part
on
the
suppression
of
cytokine
mRNA
expression
through
inhibition
of
NF-kappaB
activation
.

Elevated
expression
of
differentiation
inhibitory
factor
nm23
mRNA
in
monoblastic
crisis
of
a
patient
with
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
.

Differentiation
inhibitory
factor
nm23
gene
has
been
found
to
be
expressed
in
high
quantities
in
acute
myelogenous
leukemia
(
AML
)
,
especially
in
acute
monocytic
leukemia
(
AML-M5
)
and
is
suggested
as
a
new
prognostic
factor
in
AML-M5
.

We
report
an
example
of
elevated
expression
of
nm23
mRNA
in
a
patient
with
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
who
developed
monoblastic
crisis
.

Relative
levels
of
nm23-H1
and
-H2
mRNA
extracted
from
the
patient
's
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
and
bone
marrow
mononuclear
cells
were
measured
by
quantitative
reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
.

The
level
of
nm23-H1
mRNA
in
CML
cells
at
the
chronic
phase
was
as
high
as
that
in
bone
marrow
cells
from
healthy
volunteers
.

The
mRNA
level
of
nm23-H2
was
slightly
below
the
normal
level
.

At
blastic
crisis
,
however
,
expression
of
both
nm23-H1
and
-H2
mRNA
was
elevated
to
about
three
to
nine
times
of
that
at
the
chronic
phase
.

Proliferated
blastic
cells
were
positive
for
non-specific
esterase
,
and
the
serum
lysozyme
level
was
elevated
and
diagnosed
as
monoblastic
crisis
.

The
patient
received
combined
chemotherapy
but
response
was
partial
.

These
findings
are
compatible
with
our
previous
report
that
nm23
gene
is
overexpressed
in
monocytic
leukemia
.

Increased
transcription
decreases
the
spontaneous
mutation
rate
at
the
thymidine
kinase
locus
in
human
cells
.

Transcription
increases
DNA
repair
efficiency
and
modulates
the
distribution
of
certain
types
of
DNA
damage
.

Furthermore
,
increased
transcription
level
stimulates
spontaneous
mutation
rate
in
yeast
.

We
explored
whether
transcription
level
affects
spontaneous
mutation
rate
in
human
cells
.

We
first
developed
two
thymidine
kinase
(
tk
)
inducible
human
cell
lines
using
the
Gal4-Estrogen
receptor
system
.

In
our
TK6i-G3
and
G9
tk
heterozygous
cell
lines
,
the
active
tk
allele
is
linked
to
an
inducible
promoter
element
.

Tk
mRNA
is
induced
following
treatment
with
estrogen
.

Spontaneous
mutation
rate
was
significantly
decreased
in
human
cell
lines
after
induction
in
contrast
to
the
report
in
yeast
.

Thus
,
humans
may
have
evolved
different
or
additional
mechanisms
to
deal
with
transcription
related
spontaneous
mutagenesis
.

Mutation
of
BCL-6
gene
in
normal
B
cells
by
the
process
of
somatic
hypermutation
of
Ig
genes
.

Immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
genes
are
hypermutated
in
B
lymphocytes
that
are
the
precursors
to
memory
B
cells
.

The
mutations
are
linked
to
transcription
initiation
,
but
non-Ig
promoters
are
permissible
for
the
mutation
process
;
thus
,
other
genes
expressed
in
mutating
B
cells
may
also
be
subject
to
somatic
hypermutation
.

Significant
mutations
were
not
observed
in
c-MYC
,
S14
,
or
alpha-fetoprotein
(
AFP
)
genes
,
but
BCL-6
was
highly
mutated
in
a
large
proportion
of
memory
B
cells
of
normal
individuals
.

The
mutation
pattern
was
similar
to
that
of
Ig
genes
.

CD28-mediated
activation
in
CD45RA+
and
CD45RO+
T
cells
:
enhanced
levels
of
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
and
c-Rel
nuclear
translocation
in
CD45RA+
cells
.

We
have
analyzed
the
effect
of
complete
T
cell
activation
(
anti-CD3
plus
anti-CD28
)
on
the
activation
of
NF-kappaB
in
CD45RA+
(
naive
)
and
CD45RO+
(
memory/effector
)
T
cells
.

Long
exposure
(
24
h
)
induced
stronger
NF-kappaB
DNA
binding
in
CD45RA+
cells
than
in
CD45RO+
cells
.

Analysis
of
the
nuclear
c-Rel
protein
indicated
that
after
anti-CD3+anti-CD28
stimulation
the
level
of
c-Rel
was
higher
in
CD45RA+
cells
.

Analysis
of
the
cytoplasmic
inhibitor
IkappaBalpha
indicated
that
anti-CD3+anti-CD28
stimulation
induced
a
long-lasting
degradation
in
CD45RA+
cells
but
in
CD45RO+
cells
the
degradation
process
was
more
rapid
.

Because
the
CD28
costimulus
is
known
to
induce
the
production
of
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
(
ROIs
)
,
the
intracellular
ROI
levels
in
CD45RA+
and
CD45RO+
cells
were
compared
by
flow
cytometry
.

ROIs
were
produced
in
both
cell
types
,
but
more
strongly
in
CD45RA+
cells
.

The
data
presented
in
this
study
further
emphasize
the
differences
between
CD45RA+
and
CD45RO+
T
lymphocytes
in
ROI-dependent
signaling
pathways
.

Non-Hodgkin
's
lymphoma
involving
bilateral
breasts
[
see
comments
]

We
describe
here
two
cases
of
diffuse
large
cell
type
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphoma
affecting
the
bilateral
breasts
.

The
contralateral
tumor
in
one
case
appeared
17
months
after
the
first
mastectomy
,
whereas
the
bilateral
tumors
occurred
concurrently
in
the
other
patient
who
was
pregnant
and
showed
widespread
dissemination
at
initial
presentation
.

Lymphoma
cells
from
both
cases
showed
the
mature
B-cell
immunophenotype
and
had
rearrangements
of
the
BCL6
gene
.

Both
patients
developed
progressive
disease
despite
chemo-radiotherapy
and
died
of
leukemic
manifestations
.

There
were
no
apparent
pathological
features
of
lymphomas
of
mucosa-associated
lymphoid
tissue
origin

Biochemical
characterization
of
MIP-1
alpha
nuclear
protein
.

A
family
of
hematopoietic
specific
transcription
factors
,
MIP-1
alpha
nuclear
protein
(
MNP
)
family
,
has
recently
been
identified
.

They
are
intimately
involved
in
regulating
the
transcription
of
the
huMIP-1
alpha
gene
in
monocytes
,
T-cells
,
and
transformed
B-cells
.

One
member
of
the
family
(
MNP-1
)
is
essential
for
promoter
activity
in
monocytes
and
B-cells
,
while
another
(
MNP-2
)
is
required
for
full
promotor
activity
in
T-cells
.

A
third
member
of
the
family
(
MNP-3
)
is
expressed
in
PMA
induced
HL60
cells
and
probably
has
a
role
in
monocyte
differentiation
.

In
this
communication
we
demonstrate
by
two
techniques
that
MNP-1
and
MNP-2
are
distinct
but
related
factors
,
and
we
present
further
evidence
to
show
that
MNP-1
acts
as
a
heterodimer
.

Bcl-3
expression
and
nuclear
translocation
are
induced
by
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
and
erythropoietin
in
proliferating
human
erythroid
precursors
.

Bcl-3
is
a
proto-oncogene
involved
in
the
chromosomal
translocation
t
(
14
;
19
)
found
in
some
patients
with
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
.

It
shares
structural
similarities
with
and
is
a
member
of
the
IkappaB
family
of
proteins
.

In
this
report
,
involvement
of
Bcl-3
in
hematopoietic
growth
factor-stimulated
erythroid
proliferation
and
differentiation
was
examined
.

In
TF-1
cells
,
an
erythroleukemia
cell
line
,
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
and
erythropoietin
(
Epo
)
greatly
enhanced
Bcl-3
expression
at
both
the
protein
and
mRNA
levels
in
association
with
stimulation
of
proliferation
.

Bcl-3
protein
was
also
highly
expressed
in
early
burst-forming
unit-erythroid
(
BFU-E
)
-derived
erythroid
precursors
(
day
7
)
and
decreased
during
maturation
(
days
10
and
14
)
,
suggesting
that
Bcl-3
is
involved
in
normal
erythroid
proliferation
.

In
these
hematopoietic
cells
,
Bcl-3
was
hyperphosphorylated
.

GM-CSF
and
Epo
modulated
the
subcellular
localization
of
Bcl-3
.

Upon
stimulation
of
TF-1
cells
with
GM-CSF
or
Epo
,
the
nuclear
translocation
of
Bcl-3
was
dramatically
enhanced
.

Overexpression
of
Bcl-3
in
TF-1
cells
by
transient
transfection
along
with
the
NF-kappaB
factors
p50
or
p52
resulted
in
significant
induction
of
an
human
immunodeficiency
virus-type
1
(
HIV-1
)
kappaB-TATA-luceriferase
reporter
plasmid
,
demonstrating
that
Bcl-3
has
a
positive
role
in
transactivation
of
kappaB-containing
genes
in
erythroid
cells
.

Stimulation
with
GM-CSF
enhanced
c-myb
mRNA
expression
in
these
cells
.

Bcl-3
in
nuclear
extracts
of
TF-1
cells
bound
to
a
kappaB
enhancer
in
the
c-myb
promoter
together
with
NF-kappaB2/p52
and
this
binding
activity
was
enhanced
by
GM-CSF
stimulation
.

Furthermore
,
cotransfection
of
Bcl-3
with
p52
or
p50
in
TF-1
cells
resulted
in
significant
activation
of
a
c-myb
kappaB-TATA-luceriferase
reporter
plasmid
.

These
findings
suggest
that
Bcl-3
may
participate
in
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
certain
kappaB-containing
genes
involved
in
hematopoiesis
,
including
c-myb
.

5-Lipoxygenase

in

.

A
region
of
basic
amino
acids
spanning
residues
639-656
in
the
human
5-lipoxygenase
sequence
resembles
a
consensus
bipartite
nuclear

sequence
.

A
synthetic

consisting
of
the
Kaposi
fibroblast
growth
factor
signal
sequence
fused
to
the
5-lipoxygenase639-656
bipartite
nuclear
localizing
sequence
has
a
prominent
inhibitory
effect
on
5-lipoxygenase
catalysis
in
granulocytic
HL-60
cells
activated
by
calcium
ionophor
A23187
.

Recombinant
5-lipoxygenase
was
not
affected
by
the
peptide
.

The
peptide
also
inhibited
redistribution
of
5-lipoxygenase
from
the
cytosol
to
the
nuclear
membrane
of
HL-60
cells
stimulated
by
A23187
.

5-Lipoxygenase
protein
was
detected
in
nuclear
factor
kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
p65
subunit
immunoprecipitate
fractions
prepared
from
HL-60
cell
lysates
.

The
amount
of
5-lipoxygenase
protein
coimmunoprecipitated
by
NF-kappaB
antiserum
was
increased
following
A23187
stimulation
.

In
cells
treated
with
agents
that
block
5-lipoxygenase
translocation
to
the
nucleus
,
5-lipoxygenase
protein
appearing
in
the
NF-kappaB
immunoprecipitate
was
diminished
.

Our
results
implicate
an
internal
bipartite
nuclear
localizing
sequence
as
a
regulatory
domain
that
modulates
5-lipoxygenase
redistribution
and
catalysis
in
granulocytic
cells
.

Additionally
,
our
results
suggest
that
molecular
determinants
which
govern
5-lipoxygenase
and
NF-kappaB
redistribution
to
the
nucleus
may
be
coordinately
controlled
in
granulocytic
cells

Inhibition
of
CD28/CD3-mediated
costimulation
of
naive
and
memory
human
T
lymphocytes
by
intracellular
incorporation
of
polyclonal
antibodies
specific
for
the
activator
protein-1
transcriptional
complex
.

A
number
of
indirect
methods
have
been
utilized
in
demonstrating
activator
protein-1
transcription
factor
function
in
IL-2
promoter
activity
.

However
,
there
has
been
no
direct
demonstration
that
activator
protein-1
is
involved
in
CD28-dependent
costimulation
of
IL-2
gene
transcription
in
freshly
isolated
naive
and
memory
human
T
lymphocytes
.

To
address
this
issue
,
the
method
of
scrape
loading
was
applied
to
purified
peripheral
blood
T
lymphocytes
.

Since
scrape
loading
relies
on
adherent
cells
,
peripheral
blood
human
T
(
PB-T
)
cells
were
immobilized
on
the
nonspecific
cell
attachment
factor
poly-L-lysine
.

Cells
scraped
off
poly-L-lysine
in
the
presence
of
Ig
FITC
efficiently
incorporated
Ig
,
with
relatively
uniform
fluorescence
.

T
cells
retained
their
physical
parameters
as
measured
by
forward
and
side
light
scatter
,
and
functional
activity
as
measured
by
costimulation
of
proliferation
and
IL-2
production
after
being
scraped
off
this
substrate
.

CD28/CD3-costimulated
T
cells
produced
intracellular
IL-2
from
all
subsets
measured
(
CD4+
,
CD4-
,
CD45RO+
,
and
CD45RO-
)
.

IL-2
production
and
intracellular
accumulation
in
nonscraped
PB-T
cells
activated
with
CD28/CD3
coligation
were
skewed
favoring
CD45RO+
and
CD4+
subsets
,
as
was
IL-2
production
in
scraped
PB-T
cells
.

The
intracellular
incorporation
of
Abs
specific
for
c-Fos
and
c-Jun
family
members
by
scrape
loading
inhibited
the
production
and
intracellular
accumulation
of
IL-2
within
6
h
of
costimulation
with
PMA/ionomycin
,
or

and
the
first
direct
evidence
that
c-Fos
and
c-Jun
are
involved
in
transcription
of
the

,
in

.

Differential
expression
of
Nur77
family
members
in
human
T-lymphotropic
virus
type
1-infected
cells
:
transactivation
of
the
TR3/nur77
gene
by
Tax
protein
.

We
analyzed
the
differential
expression
and
regulation
of
three
members
of
the
Nur77
transcription
factor
family
by
the
human
T-lymphotropic
virus
type
1
(
HTLV-1
)
Tax
protein
.

We
have
demonstrated
that
in
both
HTLV-1-infected
cells
and
Tax-expressing
JPX-9
cells
,
TR3/nur77
is
highly
expressed
,
whereas
neither
NOR-1
nor
NOT
expression
is
detectable
.

Transient
transfection
analysis
further
confirmed
the
Tax
transactivation
of
the
TR3/nur77
promoter
but
not
the
NOR-1
promoter
in
different
cell
types
.

Furthermore
,
expression
of
a
luciferase
reporter
gene
driven
by
the
NGFI-B
(
rat
homolog
of
TR3/Nur77
)
response
element
(
NBRE
)
provided
evidence
that
Tax
-mediated
transactivation
resulted
in
the
induction
of
a
functional
protein
.

Cotransfection
assays
with
the
TR3/nur77
promoter
sequence
or
the
NBRE
binding
motif
together
with
a
series
of
Tax
mutants
have
shown
that
Tax
-induced
TR3/nur77
expression
is
mediated
by
CREB/ATF-related
transcription
factors
.

Negative
regulation
of
the
heat
shock
transcriptional
response
by
HSBP1
.

In
response
to
stress
,
heat
shock
factor
1
(
HSF1
)
acquires
rapid
DNA
binding
and
transient
transcriptional
activity
while
undergoing
conformational
transition
from
an
inert
non-DNA-binding
monomer
to
active
functional
trimers
.

Attenuation
of
the
inducible
transcriptional
response
occurs
during
heat
shock
or
upon
recovery
at
non-stress
conditions
and
involves
dissociation
of
the
HSF1
trimer
and
loss
of
activity
.

We
have
used
the
hydrophobic
repeats
of
the
HSF1
trimerization
domain
in
the
yeast
two-hybrid
protein
interaction
assay
to
identify
heat
shock
factor
binding
protein
1
(
HSBP1
)
,
a
novel
,
conserved
,
76-amino-acid
protein
that
contains
two
extended
arrays
of
hydrophobic
repeats
that
interact
with
the
HSF1
heptad
repeats
.

HSBP1
is
nuclear-localized
and
interacts
in
vivo
with
the
active
trimeric
state
of
HSF1
that
appears
during
heat
shock
.

During
attenuation
of
HSF1
to
the
inert
monomer
,
HSBP1
associates
with
Hsp70
.

HSBP1
negatively
affects
HSF1
DNA-binding
activity
,
and
overexpression
of
HSBP1
in
mammalian
cells
represses
the
transactivation
activity
of
HSF1
.

To
establish
a
biological
role
for
HSBP1
,
the
homologous
Caenorhabditis
elegans
protein
was
overexpressed
in
body
wall
muscle
cells
and
was
shown
to
block
activation
of
the
heat
shock
response
from
a
heat
shock
promoter-reporter
construct
.

Alteration
in
the
level
of
HSBP1
expression
in
C.
elegans
has
severe
effects
on
survival
of
the
animals
after
thermal
and
chemical
stress
,
consistent
with
a
role
for
HSBP1
as
a
negative
regulator
of
the
heat
shock
response
.

Long-range
transcriptional
regulation
of
cytokine
gene
expression
.

Most
studies
on
the
control
of
cytokine
gene
expression
have
involved
the
functional
analysis
of
proximal
promoters
.

Recent
work
has
identified
distal
elements
that
mediate
long-range
cytokine
gene
regulation
and
has
implicated
chromatin
reorganization
in
regulation
of
cytokine
gene
loci
.

These
studies
have
begun
to
elucidate
the
basis
for
cell-specificity
and
high-level
expression
of
cytokine
genes
.

A
signaling
complex
of
Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase
IV
and
protein
phosphatase
2A
[
see
comments
]

Stimulation
of
T
lymphocytes
results
in
a
rapid
increase
in
intracellular
calcium
concentration
(
[
Ca2+
]
i
)
that
parallels
the
activation
of
Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase
IV
(
CaMKIV
)
,
a
nuclear
enzyme
that
can
phosphorylate
and
activate
the
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
(
cAMP
)
response
element-binding
protein
(
CREB
)
.

However
,
inactivation
of
CaMKIV
occurs
despite
the
sustained
increase
in
[
Ca2+
]
i
that
is
required
for
T
cell
activation
.

A
stable
and
stoichiometric
complex
of
CaMKIV
with
protein
serine-threonine
phosphatase
2A
(
PP2A
)
was
identified
in
which
PP2A
dephosphorylates
CaMKIV
and
functions
as
a
negative
regulator
of
CaMKIV
signaling
.

In
Jurkat
T
cells
,
inhibition
of
PP2A
activity
by
small
t
antigen
enhanced
activation
of
CREB
-mediated
transcription
by
CaMKIV
.

These
findings
reveal
an
intracellular
signaling
mechanism
whereby
a
protein
serine-threonine
kinase
(
CaMKIV
)
is
regulated
by
a
tightly
associated
protein
serine-threonine
phosphatase
(
PP2A
)
.

Hypoxia
down-regulates
MCP-1
expression
:
implications
for
macrophage
distribution
in
tumors
.

Monocyte
chemoattractant
protein
1
(
MCP-1
)
is
likely
to
contribute
to
the
macrophage
infiltrate
in
human
ovarian
carcinomas
.

Although
MCP-1
is
predominantly
expressed
by
the
tumor
parenchyma
,
macrophages
accumulate
at
highest
density
in
necrotic
regions
,
which
are
associated
with
low
oxygen
tensions
.

Tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
can
stimulate
MCP-1
production
and
is
also
present
within
ovarian
carcinomas
.

We
have
investigated
the
effect
of
hypoxia
both
on
MCP-1
expression
in
ovarian
cancer
cell
lines
and
monocyte
migration
.

Hypoxia
down-regulated
TNF-alpha-induced
MCP-1
mRNA
and
protein
production
by
ovarian
cancer
cells
.

The
effect
was
mimicked
by
cobalt
chloride
and
desferrioxamine
,
consistent
with
a
specific
oxygen-sensing
mechanism
.

Unlike
antioxidants
,
hypoxia
did
not
inhibit
nuclear
factor
KB
mobilization
.

Monocyte
migration
in
response
to
MCP-1
was
also
diminished
under
hypoxic
conditions
.

Down-regulation
of
MCP-1
expression
and
the
inhibition
of
monocyte
migration
are
independent
effects
of
hypoxia
that
may
contribute
to
the
distribution
of
macrophages
within
ovarian
tumors
.

Activation
of
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
inflammatory
bowel
disease
[
see
comments
]

BACKGROUND
:
Expression
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
is
increased
in
the
intestinal
lamina
propria
of
patients
with
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
.

Nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NF
kappa
B
)
controls
transcription
of
inflammation
genes
.

On
activation
,
NF
kappa
B
is
rapidly
released
from
its
cytoplasmic
inhibitor
(
I
kappa
B
)
,
transmigrates
into
the
nucleus
,
and
binds
to
DNA
response
elements
in
gene
promoter
regions
.

AIMS
:
To
investigate
whether
increased
activation
of
NF
kappa
B
is
important
in
IBD
and
may
be
down-regulated
by
anti-inflammatory
treatment
.

METHODS
:
Activation
of
NF
kappa
B
was
determined
by
western
blot
assessment
and
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
in
nuclear
extracts
of
colonic
biopsy
samples
as
well
as
lamina
propria
mononuclear
cells
.

RESULTS
:
Nuclear
levels
of
NF
kappa
B
p65
are
increased
in
lamina
propria
biopsy
specimens
from
patients
with
Crohn
's
disease
in
comparison
with
patients
with
ulcerative
colitis
and
controls
.

Increased
activation
of
NF
kappa
B
was
detected
in
lamina
propria
mononuclear
cells
from
patients
with
active
IBD
.

Corticosteroids
strongly
inhibit
intestinal
NF
kappa
B
activation
in
IBD
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
by
stabilising
the
cytosolic
inhibitor
I
kappa
B
alpha
against
activation
induced
degradation
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
both
IBDs
,
but
particularly
Crohn
's
disease
,
increased
activation
of
NF
kappa
B
may
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
inflammatory
response
.

Inhibition
of
NF
kappa
B
activation
may
represent
a
mechanism
by
which
steroids
exert
an
anti-inflammatory
effect
in
IBD

Insufficient
glycemic
control
increases
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
binding
activity
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
isolated
from
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
redox-sensitive
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(
NF-kappa
B
)
is
believed
to
contribute
to
late
diabetic
complications
.

It
is
unknown
whether
NF-kappa
B
is
influenced
by
glycemic
control
.

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
To
determine
whether
NF-kappa
B
is
activated
in
patients
with
insufficient
glycemic
control
(
HbA1c
>
10
%
)
,
we
developed
a
tissue
culture-independent
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
(
EMSA
)
-based
semiquantitative
detection
system
that
allowed
us
to
determine
NF-kappa
B
activation
in
ex
vivo-isolated
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
.

We
included
43
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
in
this
cross-sectional
study
.

10
of
those
received
the
antioxidant
thioctic
acid
(
600
mg/day
p.o.
)
for
2
weeks
.

RESULTS
:
Monocytes
of
patients
with
HbA1c
levels
>
10
%
demonstrated
significantly
higher
NF-kappa
B
binding
activity
in
an
EMSA
and
a
stronger
NF-kappa
B
staining
in
immunohistochemistry
than
monocytes
of
patients
with
HbA1c
levels
of
6-8
%
.

The
increase
in
NF-kappa
B
activation
correlated
with
an
increase
in
plasmatic
markers
of
lipid
peroxidation
.

Treatment
with
the
antioxidant
thioctic
acid
decreased
NF-kappa
B
binding
activity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Hyperglycemia
induces
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappa
B
in
ex
vivo-isolated
PBMCs
of
patients
with
type
1
diabetes
.

NF-kappa
B
activation
is
at
least
partially
dependent
on
oxidative
stress
,
since
the
antioxidant
thioctic
acid
significantly
lowered
the
extent
of
NF-kappa
B
binding
activity
.

Synergistic
activation
of
MAP
kinase
(
ERK1/2
)
by
erythropoietin
and
stem
cell
factor
is
essential
for
expanded
erythropoiesis
.

Stem
cell
factor
(
SCF
)
and
erythropoietin
(
EPO
)
work
synergistically
to
support
erythropoiesis
,
but
the
mechanism
for
this
synergism
is
unknown
.

By
using
purified
human
erythroid
colony-forming
cells
(
ECFC
)
,
we
have
found
that
SCF
and
EPO
synergistically
activate
MAP
kinase
(
MAPK
,
ERK1/2
)
,
which
correlates
with
the
cell
growth
and
thus
may
be
responsible
for
the
synergistic
effects
.

Treatment
of
the
cells
with
PD98059
and
wortmannin
,
inhibitors
of
MEK
and
PI-3
kinase
,
respectively
,
inhibited
the
synergistic
activation
of
MAPK
and
also
the
cell
growth
,
further
supporting
this
conclusion
.

Wortmannin
only
inhibits
MAPK
activation
induced
by
EPO
but
not
that
by
SCF
,
suggesting
that
SCF
and
EPO
may
activate
MAPK
through
different
pathways
,
which
would
facilitate
synergy
.

Furthermore
,
EPO
,
but
not
SCF
,
led
to
activation
of
STAT5
,
whereas
SCF
and
wortmannin
had
no
effect
on
the
EPO
-induced
STAT5
activation
,
suggesting
that
STAT5
is
not
involved
in
the
synergistic
action
of
SCF
and
EPO
.

Together
,
the
data
suggest
that
synergistic
activation
of
MAPK
by
SCF
and
EPO
is
essential
for
expanded
erythropoiesis
.

The
molecular
and
phenotypic
profile
of
primary
central
nervous
system
lymphoma
identifies
distinct
categories
of
the
disease
and
is
consistent
with
histogenetic
derivation
from
germinal
center-related
B
cells
.

Primary
central
nervous
system
lymphoma
(
PCNSL
)
is
a
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
among
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
-infected
individuals
.

The
precise
histogenetic
derivation
and
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
PCNSL
is
poorly
understood
.

In
an
attempt
to
clarify
the
histogenesis
and
pathogenesis
of
these
lymphomas
,
49
PCNSL
(
26
acquired
immunodeficiency
syndrome
[
AIDS
]
-related
and
23
AIDS-unrelated
)
were
analyzed
for
multiple
biologic
markers
,
which
are
known
to
bear
histogenetic
and
pathogenetic
significance
for
mature
B-cell
neoplasms
.

PCNSL
associated
frequently
(
50.0
%
)
with
mutations
of
BCL-6
5
'
noncoding
regions
,
which
are
regarded
as
a
marker
of
B-cell
transition
through
the
germinal
center
(
GC
)
.

Expression
of
BCL-6
protein
,
which
is
restricted
to
GC
B
cells
throughout
physiologic
B-cell
maturation
,
was
detected
in
100
%
AIDS-unrelated
PCNSL
and
in
56.2
%
AIDS-related
cases
.

Notably
,
among
AIDS-related
PCNSL
,
expression
of
BCL-6
was
mutually
exclusive
with
expression
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
-encoded
latent
membrane
protein
(
LMP
)
-1
and
,
with
few
exceptions
,
also
of
BCL-2
.

All
but
one
PCNSL
expressed
hMSH2
,
which
among
mature
B
cells
selectively
stains
GC
B
cells
.

These
data
suggest
that
PCNSL
may
be
frequently
related
to
GC
B
cells
and
may
be
segregated
into
two
major
biologic
categories
based
on
the
expression
pattern
of
BCL-6
,
LMP-1
,
and
BCL-2
.

BCL-6
(
+
)
/
LMP-1
(
-
)
/
BCL-2
(
-
)
PCNSL
occur
both
in
the
presence
and
in
the
absence
of
HIV
infection
and
consistently
display
a
large
noncleaved
cell
morphology
.

Conversely
,
BCL-6
(
-
)
/
LMP-1
(
+
)
/
BCL-2
(
+
)
PCNSL
are
restricted
to
HIV-infected
hosts
and
are
represented
by
lymphomas
with
immunoblastic
features
.

These
data
are
relevant
for
the
pathogenesis
and
histogenesis
of
PCNSL
and
may
be
helpful
to
segregate
distinct
biologic
and
prognostic
categories
of
these
lymphomas
.

Antioxidant
regulation
of
phorbol
ester-induced
adhesion
of
human
Jurkat
T-cells
to
endothelial
cells
.

Regulation
of
adhesion
molecule
expression
and
function
by
reactive
oxygen
species
via
specific
redox
sensitive
mechanisms
have
been
reported
.

The
effects
of
clinically
safe
antioxidants
in
the
regulation
of
adhesion
molecule
expression
in
human
endothelial
cells
(
ECV
)
,
and
adherence
of
human
Jurkat
T
cells
to
ECV
cells
were
investigated
.

The
thiol
antioxidant
,
alpha-lipoate
,
at
clinically
relevant
doses
down-regulated
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
(
PMA
)
-induced
adhesion
molecule
expression
and
cell-cell
adhesion
.

Inhibition
of
PMA-induced
ICAM-1
and
VCAM-1
expression
as
well
as
PMA-induced
adhesion
of
Jurkat
T-cells
to
ECV
cells
by
alpha-lipoate
was
dose
dependent
(
50-250
microM
)
.

The
effect
was
significant
for
ICAM-1
(
p
<
.01
)
and
VCAM-1
(
p
<
.01
)
expression
in
cells
pretreated
with
100
microM
alpha-lipoate
compared
to
PMA-activated
untreated
cells
.

Inhibition
of
PMA-induced
adhesion
molecule
expression
and
cell-cell
adhesion
was
more
pronounced
when
a
combination
of
antioxidants
,
alpha-lipoate
and
alpha-tocopherol
,
were
used
compared
to
the
use
of
either
of
these
antioxidant
alone
.

The
regulation
of
adhesion
molecule
expression
and
function
by
low
concentration
of
antioxidants
investigated
does
not
appear
to
be
NF-kappaB
regulated
or
transcription
dependent
because
no
change
in
the
mRNA
response
was
observed
.

Protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
has
been
suggested
to
regulate
PMA-induced
adhesion
molecule
expression
by
post-transcriptional
stabilization
of
adhesion
molecule
mRNA
.

Alpha-lipoate
pretreatment
did
not
influence
the
response
of
PKC
activity
to
PMA
.

Oxidants
are
known
to
be
involved
in
the
regulation
of
cell
adhesion
processes
.

Treatment
of
ECV
cells
with
PMA
induced
generation
of
intracellular
oxidants
.

Alpha-lipoate
(
100
or
250
microM
)
treatment
decreased
PMA-induced
generation
of
intracellular
oxidants
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
low
concentration
of
alpha-lipaote
alone
or
in
combination
with
alpha-tocopherol
on
agonist-induced
adhesion
processes
observed
in
this
study
may
be
of
potential
therapeutic
value
.

Binding
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
to
CD4
and
CXCR4
receptors
differentially
regulates
expression
of
inflammatory
genes
and
activates
the
MEK
/ERK
signaling
pathway
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
binding
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
virions
to
CD4
receptors
stimulates
association
of
Lck
with
Raf-1
and
results
in
the
activation
of
Raf-1
kinase
in
a
Ras-independent
manner
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
HIV-1
envelope
glycoproteins
of
both
T-cell-tropic
and
macrophagetropic
strains
rapidly
activate
the
ERK/mitogen-activated

NF-kappaB
,
and
C/EBP
)
and
stimulate
expression
of
cytokine
and
chemokine
genes
.

The
activation
of
this
signaling
pathway
requires
functional
CD4
receptors
and
is
independent
of
binding
to
CXCR4
.

Binding
of
the
natural
ligand
stromal
cell-derived
factor
1
(
SDF-1
)
to
CXCR4
,
which
inhibits
entry
of
T-cell-tropic
HIV-1
,
activates
also
the
ERK/
MAP
kinase
pathway
.

However
,
SDF-1
did
not
affect
the
CD4-mediated
expression
of
cytokine
and
chemokine
genes
.

These
results
provide
firm
molecular
evidence
that
binding
of
HIV-1
envelope
glycoproteins
to
CD4
receptor
initiates
a
signaling
pathway
(
s
)
independent
of
the
binding
to
the
chemokine
receptor
that
leads
to
the
aberrant
expression
of
inflammatory
genes
and
may
contribute
significantly
to
HIV-1
replication
as
well
as
to
deregulation
of
the
immune
system
.

Antigen
receptor
signaling
induces
MAP
kinase-mediated
phosphorylation
and
degradation
of
the
BCL-6
transcription
factor
.

The
bcl-6
proto-oncogene
encodes
a
POZ/zinc
finger
transcriptional
repressor
expressed
in
germinal
center
(
GC
)
B
and
T
cells
and
required
for
GC
formation
and
antibody
affinity
maturation
.

Deregulation
of
bcl-6
expression
by
chromosomal
rearrangements
and
point
mutations
of
the
bcl-6
promoter
region
are
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
B-cell
lymphoma
.

The
signals
regulating
bcl-6
expression
are
not
known
.

Here
we
show
that
antigen
receptor
activation
leads
to
BCL-6
phosphorylation
by
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
.

Phosphorylation
,
in
turn
,
targets
BCL-6
for
rapid
degradation
by
the
ubiquitin
/
proteasome
pathway
.

These
findings
indicate
that
BCL-6
expression
is
directly
controlled
by
the
antigen
receptor
via
MAPK
activation
.

This
signaling
pathway
may
be
crucial
for
the
control
of
B-cell
differentiation
and
antibody
response
and
has
implications
for
the
regulation
of
other
POZ/zinc
finger
transcription
factors
in
other
tissues
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
are
differentially
expressed
in
the
cells
and
tissues
of
the
immune
system
.

Cytosolic
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
binding
studies
on
immune
tissues
demonstrate
that
the
thymus
exhibits
three
to
four
times
higher
levels
of
GR
protein
than
the
spleen
.

High
levels
of
GR
are
consistent
with
the
exquisite
sensitivity
of
the
thymus
to
glucocorticoid
exposure
.

Nevertheless
,
whole
cell
binding
studies
reveal
similar
levels
of
GR
in
immature
thymic
T
lymphocytes
and
more
mature
,
splenic
T
lymphocytes
.

Moreover
,
whole
cell
binding
techniques
indicate
that
neutrophils
(
which
represent
roughly
30
%
of
splenic
leukocytes
)
exhibit
higher
GR
than
both
T
and
B
lymphocytes
,
further
contradicting
results
from
cytosolic
binding
studies
.

To
address
these
inconsistencies
,
GR
protein
was
assessed
in
immune
cells
and
tissues
using
cytosolic
radioligand
binding
.

Western
blot
analysis
,
and
immunocytochemistry
.

Consistent
with
previous
cytosolic
receptor
binding
studies
on
immune
tissue
homogenates
,
thymic
T
cells
were
found
to
have
higher
levels
of
GR
than
T
cells
isolated
from
the
spleen
.

In
addition
,
neutrophils
were
found
to
have
fewer
GR
than
lymphocytes
and
monocytes
.

These
results
indicate
a
meaningful
relationship
between
receptor
expression
and
known
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
.

Functional
replacement
of
the
mouse
E2A
gene
with
a
human
HEB
cDNA
.

The
mammalian
E2A
,
HEB
,
and
E2-2
genes
encode
a
unique
class
of
basic
helix-loop-helix
(
bHLH
)
transcription
factors
that
are
evolutionarily
conserved
and
essential
for
embryonic
and
postnatal
development
.

While
the
structural
and
functional
similarities
among
the
gene
products
are
well
demonstrated
,
it
is
not
clear
why
deletion
of
E2A
,
but
not
HEB
or
E2-2
,
leads
to
a
complete
arrest
in
B-lymphocyte
development
.

To
understand
the
molecular
basis
of
the
functional
specificity
between
E2A
and
HEB
/
E2-2
in
mammalian
development
,
we
generated
and
tested
a
panel
of
E2A
knockin
mutations
including
subtle
mutations
in
the
E12
and
E47
exons
and
substitution
of
both
E12
and
E47
exons
with
a
human
HEB
cDNA
.

We
find
that
the
alternatively
spliced
E12
and
E47
bHLH
proteins
of
the
E2A
gene
play
similar
and
additive
roles
in
supporting
B
lymphopoiesis
.

Further
,
we
find
that
HEB
driven
by
the
endogenous
E2A
promoter
can
functionally
replace
E2A
in
supporting
B-cell
commitment
and
differentiation
toward
completion
.

Finally
,
the
postnatal
lethality
associated
with
E2A
disruption
is
fully
rescued
by
the
addition
of
HEB
.

This
study
suggests
that
the
functional
divergence
among
E12
,
E47
,
and
HEB
in
different
cell
types
is
partially
defined
by
the
context
of
gene
expression
.

Biased
dependency
of
CD80
versus
CD86
in
the
induction
of
transcription
factors
regulating
the
human
IL-2
promoter
.

In
addition
to
the
signals
obtained
by
ligation
of
the
TCR
,
T
cells
need
additional
,
co-stimulatory
signals
to
be
activated
.

One
such
co-stimulatory
signal
is
delivered
when
CD28
on
T
cells
binds
to
CD80
or
CD86
on
antigen-presenting
cells
(
APC
)
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
analyzed
the
ability
of
CD80
and
CD86
to
co-stimulate
human
T
cells
activated
by
superantigen
.

Using
the
Raji
B
cell
lymphoma
,
which
express
similar
levels
of
CD80
and
CD86
,
it
was
found
that
T
cell
proliferation
was
mainly
co-stimulated
by
CD80
.

To
further
characterize
the
consequences
of
this
biased
co-stimulatory
dependency
,
we
employed
a
well-defined
system
of
transfected
CHO
cells
expressing
human
MHC
class
II
together
with
CD80
,
CD86
or
CD80
and
CD86
.

Proliferation
of
freshly
prepared
CD4+
T
cells
required
the
presence
of
either
CD80
or
CD86
.

However
,
IL-2
production
reached
only
suboptimal
levels
in
the
presence
of
CD86
but
optimal
levels
with
CD80
.

To
analyze
IL-2
transcriptional
activity
in
CD80
and
CD86
co-stimulated
T
cells
we
used
Jurkat
T
cells
transfected
with
luciferase
reporter
gene
constructs
.

CD80
induced
higher
levels
of
IL-2
promoter
-enhancer
activity
compared
to
CD86
.

Furthermore
,
the
activity
of
transcription
factors
regulating
the
IL-2
promoter-enhancer
region
including
activation
protein-1
,
CD28
response
element
and
nuclear
factor
kappaB
were
4-8
times
higher
after
CD80
compared
to
CD86
ligation
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
eventual
appearance
of
CD80
on
recently
activated
CD86+
APC
is
important
for
the
superinduction
of
IL-2
production
and
to
support
vigorous
T
cell
proliferation
.

Duplication
of
the
DR3
gene
on
human
chromosome
1p36
and
its
deletion
in
human
neuroblastoma
.

The
human
DR3
gene
,
whose
product
is
also
known
as
Wsl-1/APO-3/TRAMP/LARD
,
encodes
a
tumor
necrosis
factor-related
receptor
that
is
expressed
primarily
on
the
surface
of
thymocytes
and
lymphocytes
.

DR3
is
capable
of
inducing
both
NF-kappa
B
activation
and
apoptosis
when
overexpressed
in
mammalian
cells
,
although
its
ligand
has
not
yet
been
identified
.

We
report
here
that
the
DR3
gene
locus
is
tandemly
duplicated
on
human
chromosome
band
1p36.2-p36.3
and
that
these
genes
are
hemizygously
deleted
and/or
translocated
to
another
chromosome
in
neuroblastoma
(
NB
)
cell
lines
with
amplified
MYCN
.

Duplication
of
at
least
a
portion
of
the
DR3
gene
,
including
the
extracellular
and
transmembrane
regions
but
not
the
cytoplasmic
domain
,
was
demonstrated
by
both
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
and
genomic
Southern
blotting
.

In
most
NB
cell
lines
,
both
the
DR3
and
the
DR3L
sequences
are
simultaneously
deleted
and/or
translocated
to
another
chromosome
.

Finally
,
DR3/
Wsl-1
protein
expression
is
quite
variable
among
these
NB
cell
lines
,
with
very
low
or
undetectable
levels
in

Differential
protection
of
normal
and
malignant
human
myeloid
progenitors
(
CFU-GM
)
from
Ara-C
toxicity
using
cycloheximide
.

Cycloheximide
,
a
reversible
protein
synthesis
inhibitor
,
is
thought
to
block
DNA
replication
in
normal
cells
by
preventing
synthesis
of
a
labile
protein
.

In
animal
systems
,
cycloheximide
protects
normal
cells
from
cytotoxic
S-phase
specific
agents
,
such
as
cytosine
arabinoside
(
Ara-C
)
.

Malignant
cells
appear
not
to
be
susceptible
to
cycloheximide-induced
cycle
arrest
and
,
subsequently
,
may
not
be
protected
from
Ara-C
cytotoxicity
.

The
effect
of
cycloheximide
on
granulocyte/macrophage
progenitors
(
CFU-GM
)
after
in
vitro
Ara-C
exposure
was
examined
using
normal
human
bone
marrow
,
malignant
progenitors
from
patients
with
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
and
clonogenic
cells
from
the
human
acute
nonlymphocytic
leukemia
cell
lines
HL-60
and
KG-1
.

Mononuclear
or
clonogenic
cells
were
incubated
for
one
hour
with
cycloheximide
,
followed
by
the
addition
,
for
three
or
17
hours
,
of
Ara-C
before
being
plated
in
a
methylcellulose
culture
system
.

CFU-GM
survival
was
significantly
increase
if
normal
cells
were
treated
with
cycloheximide
before
Ara-C
exposure
.

Similar
cycloheximide
pretreatment
of
CML
progenitors
and
clonogenic
HL-60
and
KG-1
cells
failed
to
protect
CFU-GM
from
Ara-C-induced
cytotoxicity
.

Primary
cortisol
resistance
accompanied
by
a
reduction
in
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
two
members
of
the
same
family
.

This
report
describes
studies
of
a
man
suspected
of
having
primary
cortisol
resistance
.

This
conclusion
is
based
on
his
high
plasma
cortisol
levels
and
high
24-h
urinary
17-hydroxycorticosteroid
and
cortisol
excretion
,
plus
the
fact
that
he
had
no
manifestations
of
Cushing
's
syndrome
.

Among
family
members
tested
,
his
mother
also
had
hypercortisolemia
.

Both
mother
and
son
had
high
levels
of
unbound
plasma
cortisol
,
but
their
plasma
ACTH
concentrations
were
within
the
normal
range
.

Both
were
partially
resistant
to
dexamethasone
adrenal
suppression
,
and
both
had
mild
hypertension
without
hypokalemia
.

To
study
this
apparent
end-organ
resistance
to
cortisol
,
we
examined
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
peripheral
mononuclear
cells
.

Using
whole
cell
assays
,
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
both
patients
were
found
to
have
reduced
total
binding
capacity
.

We
conclude
that
these
two
patients
,
members
of
the
same
family
,
have
primary
cortisol
resistance
accompanied
by
a
reduced
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

[
Glucocorticoid
receptors
and
response
to
polychemotherapy
in
acute

leukemia
]

Glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
levels
were
quantified
in
leukemic
blasts
from
peripheral
blood
of
86
patients
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
.

The
subsequent
achievement
of
complete
remission
after
combination
chemotherapy
was
correlated
with
high
receptor
levels
.

Forty-seven
of
50
patients
with
leukemic
cells
containing
more
than
6

000
receptor
sites
and
22
of
36
patients
with
cells
containing
less
than
6
,
000

sites
achieved
remission
.

The
study
of
glucocorticoid

in

may
predict
response
to
combination

in
patients
with

Specific
uptake
of
1
,
25-dihydroxycholecalciferol
by
human
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
cells
.

We
have
examined
mononuclear
cell
preparations
from
patients
with
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
[
CML
]
for
binding
of
and
response
to
1
,
25-dihydroxycholecalciferol
[
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
]
.

Whole
cells
specifically
took
up
[
3H
]
-1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
with
high
affinity
(
Kd
3.6
X
10
(
-11
)
M
)
and
low
capacity
.

Subcellular
fractionation
of
labeled
cells
showed
that
binding
was
restricted
to
cytosols
and
nuclei
.

Sucrose
gradient
centrifugation
of
cells
preincubated
with
[
3H
]
-1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
revealed
a
single
3.6S
peak
which
was
totally
displaced
with
100-fold
excess
nonradioactive
hormone
.

However
,
we
were
unable
to
demonstrate
specific
binding
of
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
by
postlabeling
standard
cytosol
preparations
.

In
addition
,
cytosols
prepared
from
a
mixture
of
CML
cells
and
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
receptor-positive
T47D
(
human
breast
cancer
)
cells
had
less
than
10
%
of
the
binding
measured
in
T47D
cytosol
alone
.

However
,
the
levels
of
binding
in
T47D
cytosols
were
not
reduced
if
the
receptors
were
occupied
with
[
3H
]
-1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
prior
to
the
addition
of
the
CML
cytosols
.

Thus
,
CML
cells
appear
to
contain
both
the
receptor
for
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
and
an
unknown
substance
which
prevents
its
detection
following
the
preparation
of
cytosol
.

Cells

than

or
than
did
cells

[
2.6

Only
cells
from
the

responded
to
the
addition
of
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
by
differentiating
along
the
monocyte-macrophage
pathway
.

We
conclude
that
the
differentiation-induction
effect
of
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
is
likely
to
depend
on
adequate
levels
of
receptor
and
that
intact
cells
rather
than
cytosol
preparations
should
be
studied
before

of
a
particular

are
designated
as

Effect
of
cell
cycle
position
on
dexamethasone
binding
by
mouse
and
human
lymphoid
cell
lines
:
correlation
between
an
increase
in
dexamethasone
binding
during
S
phase
and
dexamethasone
sensitivity
.

We
determined
the
effect
of
cell
cycle
position
on
the
amount
of
dexamethasone
that
was
specifically
bound
by
mouse
and
human
lymphoid
cell
lines
.

Cell
lines
that
were
either
sensitive
or
resistant
to
growth
inhibition
by
dexamethasone
were
compared
.

Exponentially
growing
cells
were
separated
by
centrifugal
elutriation
into
fractions
that
corresponded
to
different
positions
in
the
cell
cycle
.

The
cell
cycle
phase
distribution
of
each
fraction
was
estimated
by
flow
cytometry
and
autoradiography
.

The
amount
of
dexamethasone
bound
per
cell
in
each
fraction
was
measured
by
a
whole
cell
binding
assay
.

In
three
dexamethasone-sensitive
cell
lines
(
two
mouse
and
one
human
)
,
we
found
that
the
amount
of
dexamethasone
bound
per
cell
increased
2-4-fold
between
G1
phase
and
S
phase
,
and
then
decreased
during
G2/M
phase
.

Results
were
the
same
when
the
amount
of
dexamethasone
bound
per
milligram
of
cell
protein
was
measured
.

Binding
affinity
was
the
same
during
G1
phase
and
S
phase
,
but
the
proportion
of
bound
dexamethasone
that
translocated
to
the
nucleus
was
greater
during
S
phase
.

In
contrast
,
we
found
that
the
amount
of
dexamethasone
bound
per
cell
by
three
dexamethasone-resistant
cell
lines
(
two
mouse
and
one
human
)
did
not
increase
during
S
phase
.

Our
results
indicate
that
cell
cycle
changes
in
dexamethasone
binding
are
not
simply
related
to
changes
in
cell
protein
or
cell
volume
during
the
cell
cycle
.

An
increase
in
dexamethasone
binding
during
S
phase
may
be
required
for
dexamethasone
to
inhibit
cell
growth
,
and
a
failure
of
dexamethasone
binding
to
increase
during
S
phase
might
represent
a
new
mechanism
of
dexamethasone
resistance
in
lymphoid
cells
.

dexamethasone
in
vitro
increased
enzyme
activity
above
the
control
levels
.

The
increase
was
specific
for
glucocorticoid
receptor
ligands
.

A
direct
correlation
was
found
between
the
magnitude
of
glucocorticoid-mediated
increase
of
GS
activity
and
the
cellular
levels
of
specific
glucocorticoid
receptors
assayed
in
the
same
cell
specimen
.

Moreover
,
the
basal
levels
of
the
enzyme
measured
in
cells
prior
to
exposure
to
dexamethasone
correlated
negatively
with
receptor
density
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
presence
of
steroid-inducible
GS
in
ALL
cells
may
prove
to
be
a
marker
for
functional
receptor
sites
.

Binding
of
progestins
to
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

Correlation
to
their
glucocorticoid-like
effects
on
in
vitro
functions
of
human
mononuclear
leukocytes
.

A
number
of
physiological
and
synthetic
progestins
were
tested
for
their
ability
to
compete
with
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
for
the
binding
to
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
of
human
mononuclear
leukocytes
and
their
ability
to
elicit
glucocorticoid-like
effects
on
the
same
cells
.

As
compared
to
the
reference
compound
dexamethasone
(
relative
receptor
binding
affinity
defined
as
100
%
)
,
two
potent
synthetic
progestins
with
a
pregnane-type
structure
,
megestrol
acetate
and
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
,
were
found
to
display
a
considerable
binding
affinity
towards
the
receptor
(
46
and
42
%
,
respectively
)
.

The
relative
binding
affinity
of
the
naturally
occurring
ligand
,
cortisol
,
to
the
receptor
was
clearly
lower
(
25
%
)
.

The
effective
binding
of
medroxyprogesterone
acetate
to
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
was
confirmed
by
direct
binding
studies
utilizing
a
tritiated
derivative
of
this
steroid
.

No
evidence
for
the
existence
of
a
specific
progesterone
receptor
in
human
mononuclear
leukocytes
was
obtained
as
judged
by
the
results
of
competition
experiments
where
a
progesterone
receptor-specific
ligand
[
3H
]
Org
2058
was
used
.

Medroxyprogesterone
acetate
and
megestrol
acetate
also
induced
glucocorticoid-like
effects
on
the
lymphocyte
functions
.

These
included
inhibition
of
the
proliferative
responses
to
the
T-cell
mitogens
concanavalin
A
and
phytohaemagglutinin
and
an
enhanced
accumulation
of
immunoglobulin
secreting
cells
in
pokeweed
mitogen-stimulated
cultures
.

The
progestin
effect
appears
to
be
mediated
through
a
radiosensitive
(
suppressor
)
subpopulation
of
T
lymphocytes
.

In
contrast
,
the
synthetic
progestins
related
structurally
to
19-nortestosterone
,
norethisterone
and
d-norgestrel
,
were
virtually
devoid
of
binding
affinity
towards
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
nor
did
they
measurably
influence
the
in
vitro
lymphocyte
functions
.

These
studies
demonstrate
that
certain
progestins
in
common
clinical
use
probably
possess
inherent
glucocorticoid
activity
and
suggest
that
side
effects
attributable
to
this
character
(
e.g.
suppression
of
the
pituitary-adrenal
axis
)
might
be
expected
when
these
compounds
are
used
in
pharmacological
doses
.

Metabolic
and
ultrastructural
aspects
of
the
in
vitro
lysis
of
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
cells
by
glucocorticoids
.

Human
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
cells
like
prothymocytes
and
immunoactivated
T-lymphocytes
are
readily
lysed
in
vitro
by
pharmacological
concentrations
of
glucocorticoids
such
as
cortisol
,
whereas
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
and
thymocytes
are
unaffected
by
the
hormone
.

In
this
study
,
metabolic
and
ultrastructural
aspects
of
the
cortisol-induced
killing
process
of
CLL
cells
are
recorded
.

In
vitro
lysis
was
found
to
be
temperature
dependent
and
was
detected
only
after
6
to
8
hr
incubation
with
cortisol
by
means
of
the
trypan
blue
exclusion
test
.

However
,
30
min
of
incubation
with
cortisol
at
either
37
degrees
or
4
degrees
followed
by
the
removal
of
the
hormone
was
still
sufficient
to
induce
the
lytic
process
.

Ultrastructural
studies
demonstrated
sequential
changes
in
the
cytoplasm
,
including
swelling
of
mitochondria
and
cytoplasmic
decompartmentalization
,
followed
by
loss
of
surface
microvilli
with
the
appearance
of
``
holes
''
in
the
cell
membrane
,
and
subsequent
condensation
of
nuclear
chromatin
.

The
large
holes
in
the
membrane
appearing
after
6
hr
of
incubation
with
the
hormone
may
be
the
cause
for
the
penetration
of
the
viable
stain
into
the
dead
cells
,
as
seen
by
light
microscopy
.

Addition
of
metabolic
inhibitors
including
actinomycin
D
,
puromycin
,
and
cycloheximide
following
administration
of
cortisol
resulted
in
inhibition
of
the
cell
lysis
.

An
excess
of
an
antagonist
such
as
cortexolone
was
found
to
inhibit
the
cortisol-induced
cytolysis
of
the
CLL
cells
.

It
is
suggested
that
the
glucocorticoid-induced
lysis
of
human
CLL
cells
is
similar
to
the
phenomenon
observed
in
rat
or
murine
lymphocytes
and
is
mediated
by
interaction
of
the
steroid
molecule
with
the
cytoplasmic
receptor
.

The
resulting
complex
appears
to
activate
specific
gene
(
s
)
the
products
of
which
eventually
cause
cytolysis
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
in
lymphoid
tumors
.

There
is
a
range
of
levels
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
numbers
seen
in
the
various
subclasses
of
acute
lymphatic
leukemia
(
ALL
)
.

This
variability
can
not
be
explained
by
the
known
correlation
between
active
cell
proliferation
and
an
increase
in
the
number
of
receptors
,
since
the
tumors
with
the
highest
growth
fraction
(
i.e.
,
Burkitt
's
lymphoma
and
T-cell
leukemia
)
tend
to
have
lower
average
receptor
numbers
than
do
tumors
with
lower
growth
fractions
such
as
common
ALL
.

All
clinical
specimens
from
patients
with
lymphatic
leukemia
have
some
measurable
level
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
;
therefore
,
the
resistance
seen
in
vivo
can
not
be
explained
by
the
lack
of
receptors
.

However
,
there
has
been
a
positive
correlation
,
in
our
hands
,
with
receptor
level
and
prognosis
.

On
the
basis
of
in
vitro
models
,
it
is
proposed
that
perhaps
the
high
receptor
cell
lines
(
i.e.
,
common
ALL
of
childhood
)
have
relative
stability
of
their
genetic
material
making
glucocorticoid-resistant
mutations
less
likely
to
occur
in
patients
with
these
cells
than
in
low-receptor
cell
lines
(
i.e.
,
T-cell
leukemia
)
.

This
greater
genetic
variability
in
the
low-receptor
lines
could
account
for
the
earlier
emergence
of
clinical
glucocorticoid
resistance
in
these
patients
.

Aldosterone-receptor
deficiency
in
pseudohypoaldosteronism
.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism
,
a
syndrome
characterized
by
salt
wasting
and
failure
to
thrive
,
usually
presents
in
infancy
as
high
urinary
levels
of
sodium
despite
hyponatremia
,
hyperkalemia
,
hyperreninemia
,
and
elevated
aldosterone
levels
.

We
have
investigated
this
syndrome
for
the
possibility
of
abnormal
Type
I
or
``
mineralocorticoid-like
''
receptors
,
which
have
intrinsic
steroid
specificity
indistinguishable
from
that
of
renal
mineralocorticoid
receptors
and
are
found
in
many
tissues
and
cells
,
including
mononuclear
leukocytes
.

We
have
studied
three
patients
with
pseudohypoaldosteronism
:
the
28-year-old
index
case
in
Melbourne
(
Patient
1
)
and
two
siblings
in
Munich
,
eight
and
two
years
of
age
(
Patients

)
;
clinically
,
Patient

had
a
less
severe
case
than
his
sister
.

.

On
repeated
examination
,
no
[

aldosterone
binding
was
found
in
monocytes
from
Patients

;
in

,
the

below
those
of

.

Levels
in
the
parents
of
the
Munich
patients
(
first

)
were
normal
.

It
appears
that
pseudohypoaldosteronism
is
caused
by
a
Type
I
receptor
defect
,
that
the
defect
may
be
complete
or
partial
,
that
transmission
may
be
autosomal
recessive
,
and
that
the
study
of
patients
with
pseudohypoaldosteronism
may
indicate
physiologic
roles
for

in

Glucocorticoid
inhibition
of
urokinase-like
plasminogen
activators
in
cultured
human
lymphoblasts
.

Two
human
lymphoblast
cell
lines
,
LICR-LON-HMy2
(
HMy2
cells
)
and
GM4672A
cells
,
are
moderately
growth
inhibited
by
dexamethasone
(
1
,
4-pregnadien-9-fluoro-16
alpha-methyl-11
beta
,
17
alpha
,
21-triol-3
,
20-dione
)
(
Dex
)
.

Both
cell
types
secrete
a
urokinase
(
UK
)
-like
plasminogen
activator
(
PA
)
.

Treatment
of
both
HMy2
and
GM4672A
cells
with
Dex
for
1-4
days
inhibits
extracellular
PA
activity
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
,
being
half-maximal
at
approximately
1
X
10
(
-9
)
M
.

Inhibition
of
PA
in
both
cell
types
is
specific
for
active
glucocorticoids
,
and
this
specificity
parallels
the
ability
of
various
steroids
to
bind
to
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

HMy2
cell
PA
is
fully
suppressible
by
Dex
,
whereas
up
to
one
third
of
the
activator
expressed
by
GM4672A
cells
is
resistant
to
glucocorticoid
inhibition
.

Mixing
experiments
using
a
UK
standard
and
conditioned
media
from
Dex-treated
cells
suggest
an
absence
of
glucocorticoid-inducible
inhibitors
to
UK
or
plasmin
in
both
cell
types
.

However
,
conditioned
media
from
Dex-treated
GM4672A
cells
inhibits
a
portion
of
the
homologous
cellular
activator
in
conditioned
media
from
control
GM4672A
cells
.

Thus
,
low
levels
of
glucocorticoid-inducible
inhibitors
may
contribute
to
,
but
can
not
fully
account
for
,
Dex
inhibition
of
GM4672A
PA
activity
.

Glucocorticoid-inducible
inhibitors
in
HMy2
cells
are
either
totally
absent
or
are
present
at
undetectable
levels
.

Thus
,
regulation
of
UK-like
PAs
in
HMy2
and
GM4672A
cells
differs
with
respect
to
the
extent
to
which
glucocorticoids
inhibit
constitutively
expressed
activator
levels
,
as
well
as
the
possible
contribution
of
glucocorticoid-inducible
inhibitors
to
the
regulatory
process
in
GM4672A
cells
.

Characterization
of
aldosterone
binding
sites
in
circulating
human
mononuclear
leukocytes
.

Aldosterone
binding
sites
in
human
mononuclear
leukocytes
were
characterized
after
separation
of
cells
from
blood
by
a
Percoll
gradient
.

After
washing
and
resuspension
in
RPMI-1640
medium
,
cells
were
incubated
at
37
degrees
C
for
1
h
with
different
concentrations
of
[
3H
]
aldosterone
plus
a
100-fold
concentration
of
RU-26988
(
11
alpha
,
17
alpha-dihydroxy-17
beta-propynylandrost-1
,
4
,
6-trien-3-one
)
,
with
or
without
an
excess
of
unlabeled
aldosterone
.

Aldosterone
binds
to
a
single
class
of
receptors
with
an
affinity
of
2.7
+/-
0.5
nM
(
means
+/-
SD
,
n
=
14
)
and
a
capacity
of
290
+/-
108
sites/cell
(
n
=

)
.

The
specificity
data
show
a
hierarchy
of
affinity
of
desoxycorticosterone
=
corticosterone
=
aldosterone
greater
than
hydrocortisone
greater
than
dexamethasone
.

The
results
indicate
that
mononuclear
leukocytes
could
be
useful
for
studying
the
physiological
significance
of
these
mineralocorticoid
receptors
and
their
regulation
in
humans
.

Mineralocorticoid
and
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
circulating
mononuclear
leukocytes
of
patients
with
primary
hyperaldosteronism
.

Mineralocorticoid
and
glucocorticoid
receptors
were
measured
in
circulating
mononuclear
leukocytes
in
5
patients
affected
by
Conn
's
syndrome
(
3
cases
of
bilateral
adrenal
hyperplasia
and
2
cases
of
adenoma
plus
unilateral
hyperplasia
)
.

The
number
of
the
binding
sites
per
cell
resulted
significantly
lower
(
189
+/-
114
,
mean
+/-
SD
)
,
as
compared
with
the
normal
controls
(
298
+/-
105
)
.

The
affinity
of
aldosterone
for
the
receptor
was
found
to
be
not
different
than
that
of
healthy
control
subjects
.

The
capacity
and
the
affinity
of
dexamethasone
for
glucocorticoid
receptors
ranged
in
the
normal
values
.

These
data
suggest
a
possible
down-regulation
of
mineralocorticoid
receptors
in
humans
.

Short-term
and
long-term
effects
of
estrogen
on
lymphoid
tissues
and

cells
with
some
remarks
on
the
significance
for
carcinogenesis
.

Estrogens
have
long
been
thought
to
play
a
role
in
regulating
the
immune
system
.

The
difference
in
some
types
of
immune
responses
between
males
and
females
is
well-known
,
as
is
the
pronounced
thymic
involution
induced
by
exogenous
estrogens
.

Estrogens
stimulate
some
aspects
of
macrophage
activity
and
,
depending
on
dose
and
mitogen
,
inhibit
or
stimulate
lymphocyte
proliferative
response
in
vitro
.

Another
example
is
the
estrogen
effect
on
the
delayed
type
hypersensitivity
response
.

A
broad
review
is
given
of
such
estrogen
effects
on
lymphoid
tissue
and
immune
response
.

Most
of
the
studies
published
so
far
are
phenomenological
.

However
,
the
recent
description
of
estrogen
receptors
in
the
thymus
and
in
some
lymphocyte
subpopulations
,
as
well
as
a
deeper
understanding
of
regulating
factors
in
the
immune
system
,
open
the
possibility
of
a
more
detailed
understanding
of
the
estrogen
mechanism
of
interference
.

Estrogen
effects
in
adults
are
reversible
.

After
treating
neonatal
mice
with
the
synthetic
estrogen
diethylstilbestrol
(
DES
)
,
disturbances
are
induced
in
lymphocyte
populations
and
lymphocyte
functions
which
are
permanent
and
irreversible
.

Lymphocytes
from
adult
,
neonatally
DES-treated
female
mice
have
a
reduced
mitogen
response
to
ConA
and
LPS
(
T
and
B
cell
mitogen
)
and
the
delayed
type
hypersensitivity
response
is
depressed
.

A
detailed
analysis
demonstrated
a
decreased
T
helper
cell
population
.

The
activity
of
Natural
Killer
cells
is
permanently
reduced
and
this
functional
impairment
is
related
to
a
decreased
number
of
these
cells
,
in
turn
determined
at
the
bone
marrow
level
.

The
same
animals
have
an
increased
sensitivity
to
chemical
carcinogens
(
methylcholanthrene
)
and
they
spontaneously
develop
epithelial
changes
in
the
uterine
cervix
which
morphologically
are
similar
to
adenocarcinoma
.

The
association
between
estrogen-associated
malignancy
and
estrogen
effects
in
lymphocyte
functions
deserves
further
study
.

Drugs
affecting

cells
(

,
in

and
after
incubation
with
drugs
which
modify
the
cellular
concentration
of
cAMP
,
PGE
and
PGF
.

The
results
demonstrated
the
presence
in
leukaemic
cells
of
an
alteration
in
the
incorporation
of
steroid
hormones
.

This
alteration
was
scarcely
modified
by
incubation
with
theophylline
,
which
increases
cellular
concentration
of
cAMP
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
was
moderately
counteracted
by
thioproline
and
was
evidently
inhibited
by
flurbiprofen
,
which
also
reduced
cellular
concentrations
of
prostaglandins
,
particularly
PGE2
,
with
the
exception
of
PGF2
which
showed
a
poor
response
.

were
observed
in

hormonal
uptake
of

,
in

to
that
of

was
significantly
less
than
in
those
with
limited
disease
(
stage

)
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
.

NK
activity
was
not
correlated
to
estrogen
or
progesterone
receptor
states
.

Positive
correlation
of
a
depressed
natural
killer
activity
with
the
extent
of
tumor
spread
supports
the
concept
of
an
NK
cell
immune
surveillance
system
in
breast
cancer
and
emphasizes
its
importance
in
this
malignancy
.

Immunosuppressive
effect
of
serum
progesterone
during
pregnancy
depends
on
the
progesterone
binding
capacity
of
the
lymphocytes
.

Cytotoxic
activity
and
progesterone
binding
capacity
of
the
lymphocytes
,
together
with
serum
progesterone
concentrations
,
were
determined
in
women
with
normal
pregnancy
or
with
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
threatened
abortion
or
threatened
premature
labour
.

The
lymphocytes
of
women
with
threatened
abortion
or
threatened
premature
labour
showed
significantly
higher
cytotoxic
activity
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
and
significantly
lower
progesterone
binding
capacity
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
than
did
lymphocytes
obtained
from
the
healthy
pregnant
women
.

Significant
inverse
correlation
was
found
between
progesterone
binding
capacity
and
cytotoxic
activity
of
the
lymphocytes
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
,
but
the
progesterone
concentration
of
the
pregnancy
serum
appeared
to
have
no
influence
on
the
other
two
parameters
.

The
findings
indicate
that
intact
progesterone
binding
capacity
of
the
lymphocytes
is
an
essential
factor
for
the
manifestation
of
the
blocking
effect
exerted
by
pregnancy
serum
on
lymphocyte

in

.

Serum

steroid
and

concentrations
,
and
endometrial
estrogen
and
progestin
receptor
levels
during
administration
of
human
leukocyte
interferon

Five
normally
cycling
healthy
women
were
given
daily
subcutaneous
injections
of
human
leukocyte
interferon
(
3
X
10
(
6
)
units/day
)
from
the
3rd
through
23rd
day
of
the
menstrual
cycle
,
and
serum
steroid
and
peptide
hormone
concentrations
monitored
at
3-day
intervals
during
the
treatment
and
the
preceding
control
cycle
.

Concentrations
of
cytosol
and
nuclear
estrogen
receptors
(
ERC
and
ERN
,
respectively
)
and
progestin
receptors
(
PRC
and
PRN
)
were
also
measured
from
endometrial
biopsies
taken
on
the
24th
day
of
the
control
and
treatment
cycle
.

In
addition
,
an
extensive
monitoring
of
clinical
chemical
and
hematological
tests
from
the
blood
samples
were
performed
.

Serum
estradiol
and
progesterone
concentrations
were
significantly
decreased
during
the
treatment
cycle
,
suggesting
that
interferon
interacts
in
vivo
with
the
function
of
both
FSH
and
LH
.

No
significant
changes
were
observed
in
the
serum
peptide
hormone
concentrations
measured
(
FSH
,
LH
,
prolactin
,
insulin
,
growth
hormone
and
TSH
)
;
neither
were
the
levels
of
endometrial
ERC
,
ERN
,
PRC
and
PRN
affected
by
interferon
administration
.

As
expected
,
interferon
administration
resulted
in
decreased
leukocyte
counts
.

Moreover
,
an
increasing
tendency
in
the
activities
of
serum
alkaline
phosphatase
and
gamma-glutamyltransferase
during
the
interferon
therapy
shows
that
interferon
may
slightly
interfere
with
the
liver
function
.

These
results
suggest
that
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
interferon
treatment
may
affect
the
growth
of
hormone-dependent
neoplasms
could
be
the
interaction
with
production
and/or
function
of
circulating
hormonal
compounds
.

[
Glucocorticoid

level
in
the

leukocytes
in
different
acute
diseases
]

Content
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
cytosol
of
blood
leukocytes
,
concentration
of
cortisol
and
amount
of
leukocytes
in
blood
were
studied
in
20
patients
with
acute
impairments
within
the
second
day
of
the
disease
.

Content
of
receptors
in
cytosol
of
blood
leukocytes
was
studied
using
3H-triamcinolone
acetonide
.

Distinct
increase
in
amount
of
the
leukocyte
glucocorticoid
receptors
was
found
in
patients
with
poisoning
by
dichlorethane
and
hypnotic
drugs
under
conditions
of
acute
myocardial
infarction
.

In
acute
pancreatitis
content
of
the
leukocyte
receptors
was
not
altered
as
compared
with
controls
.

Concentration
of
endogenous
cortisol
was
increased
in
blood
of
all
the
patients
,
except
of
the
cases
of
acetate
intoxication
.

Reverse
correlation
was
observed
between
concentration
of
cortisol
in
blood
and
content
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
leukocytes
.

But
in
the
patients
with
acute
pancreatitis
the
decrease
in
content
of
leukocyte
glucocorticoid
receptors
was
not
observed
although
there
was
an
increase
in
cortisol
concentration
in
blood
.

The
role
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
immunological
processes
under
conditions
of
purulent
complications
and
possibility
to
regulate
the
metabolism
in
leukocytes

Therapeutic
concentrations
of
glucocorticoids
suppress
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
human
macrophages
without
impairing
their
responsiveness
to
gamma
interferon
.

By
exposing
human
blood-derived
macrophages
and
alveolar
macrophages
in
vitro
to
dexamethasone
,
we
showed
in
these
studies
that
glucocorticoids
markedly
suppress
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
macrophages
but
not
macrophage
activation
by
lymphokines
.

As
little
as
2.5
X
10
(
-8
)
mol/liter
of
dexamethasone
prevented
macrophages
from
inhibiting
germination
of
Aspergillus
spores
or
from
eliminating
ingested
bacteria
such
as
Listeria
,
Nocardia
,
or
Salmonella
.

Damage
to
macrophage
function
was
inhibited
by
progesterone
and
appeared
to
be
receptor-mediated
.

In
accordance
with
in
vivo
observations
,
dexamethasone
required
24-36
h
to
suppress
antimicrobial
activity
.

While
glucocorticoids
interfered
with
base-line
activity
of
macrophages
,
dexamethasone
concentrations
comparable
to
drug
levels
in
patients
had
no
effect
on
macrophage
activation
.

Proliferating
lymphocytes
and
gamma-interferon
thus
increased
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
phagocytes
exposed
to
glucocorticoids
over
that
of
control
cells
.

Macrophage
activation
and
correction
of
the
dexamethasone
effect
by
gamma-interferon
,
however
,
was
dependent
on
the
pathogen
.

The
lymphokine
enhanced
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
dexamethasone-treated
macrophages
against
Listeria
and
Salmonella
but
not
against
Aspergillus
or
Nocardia
.

Dexamethasone-induced
damage
to
the
antimicrobial
activity
of
human
macrophages
in
vitro
parallels
observations
that
glucocorticoids
render
laboratory
animals
susceptible
to
listeriosis
and
aspergillosis
by
damaging
resident
macrophages
.

Suppression
of
macrophage
antimicrobial
activity
should
thus
be
considered
when
treating
patients
with
glucocorticoids
;
its
prevention
by
gamma-interferon
might
be
beneficial
for
some
but
not
all
pathogens
.

Interleukin
2
receptor
(
Tac
antigen
)
expression
in
HTLV-I-associated
adult
T-cell
leukemia
.

Interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
is
a
lymphokine
synthesized
by
some
T-cells
following
activation
.

Resting
T-cells
do
not
express
IL-2
receptors
,
but
receptors
are
rapidly
expressed
on
T-cells
following
interaction
of
antigens
,
mitogens
,
or
monoclonal
antibodies
with
the
antigen-specific
T-cell
receptor
complex
.

Using
anti-Tac
,
a
monoclonal
antibody
that
recognizes
the
IL-2
receptor
,
the
receptor
has
been
purified
and
shown
to
be
a
Mr
33
,
000
peptide
that
is
posttranslationally
glycosylated
to
a
Mr
55
,
000
mature
form
.

Normal
resting
T-cells
and
most
leukemic
T-cell
populations
do
not
express
IL-2
receptors
;
however
,
the
leukemic
cells
of
the
11
patients
examined
who
had
human
T-cell
lymphotropic
virus-associated
adult
T-cell
leukemia
expressed
the
Tac
antigen
.

In
human
T-cell
lymphotropic
virus-I
infected

,
the
Mr
42
,
000
long
open
reading
frame
protein
encoded
in
part
by
the
pX
region
of
this
virus
may
act
as
a
transacting
transcriptional
activator
that
induces
IL-2
receptor
gene
transcription
,
thus
providing
an
explanation
for
the
constant
association
of
IL-2
receptor
expression
with
adult
T-cell
lymphotropic
virus-I
infection
of
lymphoid
cells
.

The
constant
expression
of
large
numbers
of
IL-2
receptors
which
may
be
aberrant
may
play
a
role
in
the
uncontrolled
growth
of
adult
T-cell
leukemia
cells
.

Two
patients
with
Tac-positive
adult
T-cell
leukemia
have
been
treated
with
the
anti-Tac
.

One
of
the
patients
had
6-
and
3-mo
remissions
of
his
leukemia
following
two
courses
of
therapy
with
this
monoclonal

Lymphocyte
glucocorticoid
receptor
binding
in
depressed
patients
with
hypercortisolemia
.

Despite
elevated
levels
of
serum
and
urinary
cortisol
,
patients
with
depressive
illness
manifest
none
of
the
clinical
stigmata
of
glucocorticoid
excess
.

This
hypercortisolemia
in
the
absence
of
clinical
effects
suggests
a
state
of
hormone
resistance
and
could
be
mediated
by
alterations
in
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

Earlier
studies
have
shown
that
small
doses
of
glucocorticoids
cause
a
decrease
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
binding
in
normal
human
lymphocytes
.

White
cells
from
depressed
patients
with
significant
hypercortisolemia
would
be
expected
to
show
a
similar
change
in
receptor
concentration
if
peripheral
tissues
are
adequately
exposed
to
and
sensitive
to
the
hormone
.

In
this
study
we
compared
the
binding
of
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
to
lymphocytes
from
normal
subjects
and
depressed
patients
with
hypercortisolemia
.

Lymphocytes
from
normal
subjects
had
a
mean
receptor
concentration
of
10.2
+/-
0.66
fm/10
(
6
)
cells
(
S.E.M.
)
and
a
dissociation
constant
of
4.8
+/-
0.47
nM
.

Lymphocytes
from
depressed
patients
with
abnormal
0800
h
serum
cortisol
after
dexamethasone
had
a
mean
receptor
concentration
of
8.8
+/-
0.75
fm/10
(
6
)
cells
,
which
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
in
lymphocytes
from
normal
subjects
or
from
depressed
subjects
with
normal
post-dexamethasone
cortisol
levels
(
9.4
+/-
0.95
fm/10
(
6
)
cells
)
.

Lymphocytes
from
depressed
patients
with
elevated
urinary
free
cortisol
excretion
(
UFC
)
also
had
normal
receptor
concentration
and
binding
affinity
for
dexamethasone
.

The
lack
of
a
change
in
lymphocyte
glucocorticoid
receptor
concentration
in
the
presence
of
cortisol
excess
suggests
the
possibility
that
hypercortisolemia
in
depressive
illness
represents
a
state
of
peripheral
glucocorticoid
resistance
.

Structure
and
regulation
of
the
glucocorticoid
hormone
receptor
.

The
glucocorticoid
receptor
is
an
intracellular
protein
which
possesses
three
distinct
domains
,
one
that
binds
agonist
and
antagonist
steroids
,
one
that
binds
DNA
,
and
one
that
binds
anti-receptor
antibodies
and
is
required
for
glucocorticoid
modulation
of
gene
expression
.

In
intact
cells
,
receptor
number
,
affinity
and
activity
can
change
in
response
to
factors
that
bind
to
the
receptor
,
or
that
act
indirectly
through
ill-defined
mechanisms
which
may
include
resumption
or
arrest
of
cell
cycling
and
variations
in
intracellular
calcium
ion
concentrations
.

Some
of
these
factors
appear
to
exert
their
effect
by
controlling
critical
receptor
properties
such
as
ATP-dependent
phosphorylation
,
integrity
of
thiol
groups
,
and
exposure
of
key
amino
acid
residues
.

Glucocorticoid
agonists
promote
the
'transformation
'
of
the
receptor
into
the
DNA-binding
state
,
which
is
competent
for
modulating
gene
expression
.

Glucocorticoid
antagonists
are
steroids
that
interact
with
the
receptor
but
either
fail
to
produce
a
stable
complex
or
produce
a
stable
but
inefficient
complex
.

Although
substituent
groups
that
confer
agonist
or
antagonist
activity
to
the
steroid
have
been
identified
,
the
molecular
determinants
of
this
difference
at
the
receptor
level
remain
unknown
.

Most
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
data
on
receptor
regulation
can
be
accommodated
by
postulating
the
existence
of
an
intracellular
cycle
that
involves
five
states
of
the
receptor
.

The
active
free
receptor
is
phosphorylated
,
reduced
,
and
presumably
oligomeric
(
state
A
)
.

Following
binding
of
an
agonist
(
state
B
)
,
it
can
become
transformed
by
dissociation
into
its
subunits
and
dephosphorylation
(
state
C
)
.

The
transformed
receptor
then
interacts
with
chromatin
(
state
D
)
.

Dissociation
of
the
steroid
and
oxidation
of
receptor
thiol
group
(
s
)
lead
to
the
inactive
receptor
form
(
state
E
)
.

Reduction
and
rephosphorylation
of
the
receptor
enable
it
to
bind
steroids
again
so
that
the
cycle
is
closed
.

Thermodynamics
of
steroid
binding
to
the
human
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

The
thermodynamics
of
the
interaction
of
glucocorticoids
with
their
receptor
were
studied
in
cytosol
from
human
lymphoblastoid
cells
.

The
rate
and
affinity
constants
of
dexamethasone
and
cortisol
between
0
degree
and
25
degrees
C
were
calculated
by
curve-fitting
from
time-course
and
equilibrium
kinetics
.

The
data
were
consistent
with
a
simple
reversible
bimolecular
interaction
.

Arrhenius
and
Va
n't
Hoff
plots
were
curvilinear
for
both
steroids
.

At
equilibrium
,
the
solution
for
the
equation
delta
G
=
delta
H
-
T
X
delta
S
(
eqn.
1
)
was
(
in
kJ
X
mol-1
)
-47
=
36
-
83
(
dexamethasone
)
and
-42
=
-9
-
33
(
cortisol
)
at
0
degree
C
.

Enthalpy
and
entropy
changes
decreased
quasi-linearly
with
temperature
such
that
,
at
25
degrees
C
,
the
respective
values
were
-50
=
-75
+
25
and
-43
=
-48
+
5
.

Thus
,
for
both
steroids
,
the
interaction
was
entropy-driven
at
low
temperature
and
became
entirely
enthalpy-driven
at
20
degrees
C
.

Thermodynamic
values
for
the
transition
state
were
calculated
from
the
rate
constants
.

For
the
forward
reaction
,
eqn.
(
1
)
gave
45
=
84
-
39
(
dexamethasone
)
and
46
=
60
-
14
(
cortisol
)
at
0
degree
C
,
and
44
=
24
+
20
(
dexamethasone
)
and
46
=
28
+
18
(
cortisol
)
at
25
degrees
C
.

These
data
fit
quite
well
with
a
two-step
model
[
Ross
&
Subramanian
(
1981
)
Biochemistry
20
,
3096-3102
]
proposed
for
ligand-protein
interactions
,
which
involves
a
partial
immobilization
of
the
reacting
species
governed
by
hydrophobic
forces
,
followed
by
stabilization
of
the
complex
by
short-range
interactions
.

On
the
basis
of
this
model
,
an
analysis
of
the
transition-state
thermodynamics
led
to
the
conclusion
that
no
more
than
half
of
the
steroid
molecular
area
is
engaged
in
the
binding
process
.

Cell
cycle-related
changes
in
number
of
T-lymphocyte
receptors
for
glucocorticoids
and
insulin
.

Enriched
human
peripheral
T-lymphocytes
were
stimulated
with
PHA
and
examined
for
variations
in
insulin
and
glucocorticoid
(
dexamethasone
)
receptor
numbers
during
the
early
phases
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Cells
in
G0
,
G1a
and
G1b
phases
,
where
the
G1a
-
G1b
transition
is
an
Interleukin
2
dependent
event
,
were
quantitated
by
flow
cytometry
.

Few
but
significant
numbers
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
2700/cell
)
and
no
insulin
receptors
(
-1/cell
)
were
found
in
the
resting
(
G0
)
phase
.

As
cells
entered
the
G1a
phase
the
specific
binding
of
dexamethasone
increased
and
of
insulin
took
place
.

Although
the
specific
binding
further
increased
as
T-cells
entered
the
G1b
phase
(
as
measured
at
44
h
of
incubation
and
using
hydroxyurea-treated
cells
)
,
the
major
changes
in
the
specific
binding
of
dexamethasone
took
place
during
the
period
16
-
20
h
after
stimulation
.

Based
on
these
findings
,
it
is
concluded
that
both
receptor
types
(
cell
membrane
and
cytoplasmic
receptors
)
are
being
formed
and
increased
at
G1
phase
prior
to
cell
proliferation
,
indicating
the
importance
of
G1
phase
in
immunoregulation
.

Of

Multivariate
analysis
of

will
be
required
to
determine
the
independent

importance
of
these
factors
.

Current
treatment
strategies
in

include
(

)
tailoring

and
its

to

Late
neuropsychological

caused
by

have
prompted
programs
designed
to
reduce
the
potential
late

of

these

include

Until

,
more
intensive

and

therapy
had
failed
to
prolong
DFS
in

.

In

Germany
(

protocol
)
a
70
to
75
%
DFS
is
seen
in
all
patients
regardless
of
initial
WBC
,
suggesting
that
effective
therapy
will
override
prognostic
factors
.

Ultra-high-dose
MTX
,
without
cranial

,
is
also
showing
promise
in
poor

.

Other
issues
include
the
optimal
duration
of

,
the
role
of
testicular

,
and
prophylactic
testicular

.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
prognostic
factors
lose
their
significance
after
2
years
of
continuous
complete

and
that
2
years
of

is

.

Bilateral

A

ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED
AT
400
WORDS
)

Glucocorticoid
receptor
and
in
vitro
sensitivity
to
steroid
hormones
in
human
lymphoproliferative
diseases
and
myeloid
leukemia
.

The
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
quantitation
by
a
whole-cell
assay
and/or
cytosol
technique
and
the
in
vitro
sensitivity
to
steroids
have
been
assessed
in
peripheral
blood
cells
from
normal
donors
and
patients
with
chronic
lymphatic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
,
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
(
ALL
)
,
lymphosarcoma
cell
leukemia
(
LSCL
)
,
acute
nonlymphatic
leukemia
(
ANLL
)
,
and
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
.

Within
the
lymphoproliferative
diseases
,
ALL
cells
exhibited
the
highest
GR
concentration
(
regardless
of
the
method
used
)
and
the
highest
in
vitro
inhibition
of
spontaneous
[
3H
]
thymidine
(
[
3H
]
TdR
)
uptake
by
glucocorticoids
.

A
significant
relationship
between
GR
concentration
(
whole-cell
assay
)
and
in
vitro
sensitivity
to
dexamethasone
was
also
found
.

On
the
contrary
,
CLL
cells
presented
the
highest
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
in
PHA-stimulated
cell
cultures
.

Cells
from
the
only
two
ALL
patients
who
did
not
undergo
a
remission
after
glucocorticoid-inclusive
chemotherapy
had
both
the
lowest
in
vitro
sensitivity
to
dexamethasone
and
the
lowest
GR
concentration
with
whole-cell
assay
.

Concerning
myeloid
leukemia
,
ANLL
patients
had
GR
concentrations
slightly
higher
than
those
found
in
the
ALL
group
but
exhibited
the
lowest
degree
of
inhibition
of
spontaneous
[
3H
]
TdR
uptake
by
dexamethasone
(
stimulatory
effects
occurred
in
some
cases
)
.

CML
cells
exhibited
an
inhibition
degree
by
in
vitro
glucocorticoids
significantly
higher
than
that
of
ANLL
cells
but
not
different
from
that
of
lymphoproliferative
diseases
.

No
clear
relationship
among
GR
pattern
,
in
vitro
cell
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
,
and
clinicohematologic
parameters
was
observed
in
myeloid
leukemia-bearing
patients
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
and
in
vitro
corticosensitivity
of
peanut-positive
and
peanut-negative
human
thymocyte
subpopulations
.

In
6
human
thymus
glands
,
the
immature
subset
of
thymocytes
was
separated
from
the
more
mature
one
,
by
differential
peanut
lectin
agglutination
.

These
2
cell
subpopulations
were
analyzed
for
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
by
using
a
whole
cell
assay
,
with
(
3H
)
-triamcinolone
acetonide
as
tracer
.

The
unagglutinated
thymocytes
(
peanut
negative
)
contained
about
2
times
more
receptor
sites
per
cell
than
agglutinated
(
peanut
positive
)
ones
(
7650
+/-
1550
S.D.
verus
3195
+/-
896
S.D.
)
.

The
affinity
for
steroid
was
similar
in
both
cell
subsets
,
as
was
the
stereospecificity
for
glucocorticoids
,
the
time-course
of
steroid-receptor
association
,
and
cytoplasmic
to
nuclear
translocation
.

Despite
the
greater
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
,
the
peanut-negative
thymocyte
subpopulation
did
not
differ
from
the
peanut-positive
one
in
its
sensitivity
to
the
inhibitory
effects
of
triamcinolone
acetonide
,
as
determined
by
measurements
of
the
incorporation
of
radiolabeled
precursors
of
protein
and
DNA
.

Moreover
,
the
peanut-negative
subset
appeared
more
resistant
in
vitro
to
the
steroid-induced
cell
lysis
as
compared
to
the
peanut-positive
one
.

Thus
,
our
data
suggest
that
glucocorticoid
receptor
density
and
corticosensitivity
are
not
directly
correlated
and
that
the
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
may
be
dependent
on
the
degree
of
immunologic
maturation

Defective
binding
and
function
of
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
receptors
in
peripheral
mononuclear
cells
of
patients
with
end-organ
resistance
to
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D
.

Lectin-induced
DNA
synthesis
by
peripheral
mononuclear
cells
from
17
normal
donors
was
inhibited
(
40-60
%
)
by
1
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
1
,
25
[
OH
]
2D3
)
at
physiological
concentrations
(
10
(
-10
)
-10
(
-9
)
M
)
.

The
lymphocytes
acquire
specific
receptors
for
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
upon
activation
by
the
lectins
.

This
process
precedes
the
inhibitory
effect
of
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
.

We
studied
lymphocytes
from
six
patients
from
four
different
kindreds
with
the
syndrome
of
hereditary
end-organ
resistance
to
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D
(
the
so-called
vitamin
D-dependent
rickets
type
II
)
.

In
five
patients
(
three
kindreds
)
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
did
not
acquire
receptors
for
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
upon
phytohemagglutinin-induced
activation
.

Moreover
,
in
contrast
to
normal
lymphocytes
,
the
mitogenic
stimulation
of
these
patients
'
lymphocytes
by
phytohemagglutinin
and
concanavalin
A
was
not
inhibited
by
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
.

Activated
lymphocytes
of
the
sixth
patient
from
a
fourth
kindred
exhibited
normal
binding
of
[
3H
]
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
but
the
hormone
failed
to
inhibit
the
mitogenic
stimulation
.

A
similar
pattern
of
the
vitamin
D
effector
system
was
previously
observed
in
fibroblasts
cultured
from
skin
biopsies
of
the
same
group
of
patients
.

The
conclusions
from
these
findings
are
:
(
a
)
the
inhibition
of
mitogenic
stimulation
by
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
is
mediated
by
specific
functional
receptors
to
the
hormone
;
and
(
b
)
the
receptors
for
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
in
mononuclear
cells
are
probably
controlled
genetically
by
the
same
mechanisms
as
the
effector
system
in
well-characterized
target
organs
of
the
hormone
,
such
as
intestine
and
kidney
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
of
mononuclear
leukocytes
from
myasthenia
gravis
patients
.

The
present
study
was
performed
to
analyse
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
binding
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
leukocytes
(
MNL
)
from
39
myasthenia
gravis
(
MG
)
patients
(
unoperated
patients
(
n
=
13
)
,
thymectomized
patients
(
n
=
14
)
and
patients
receiving
glucocorticoids
:
thymectomized
(
n
=
11
)
and
unoperated
(
n
=
6
]
.

A
whole
cell
binding
assay
with
3
(
H
)
dexamethasone
was
used
.

GR
mean
values
were
significantly
higher
in
the
MNL
of
MG
patients
(
thymectomized
or
not
)
not
receiving
glucocorticoid
than
in
the
MNL
of
healthy
donors
.

Affinity
was
within
the
normal
range
.

Sex
,
age
or
clinical
forms
of
illness
did
not
influence
the
results
.

In
patients
receiving
prednisone
(
Pd
)
the
GR
values
were
significantly
lower
than
in
MG
patients
without
Pd
therapy
,
independent
of
Pd
dose
or
time
of
administration
.

No
differences
in
receptor
binding
between
normal
subjects
and
MG
patients
receiving
Pd
have
been
found
.

Immunological
interference
of
high
dose
corticosteroids
.

High-dose
corticosteroids
(
HDC
)
will
influence
cellular
as
well
as
humoral
participants
of
the
immune
response
.

The
lymphoid
tissue
will
decrease
in
size
and
weight
after
prolonged
treatment
with
HDC
.

Lymphocyte
functions
will
be
impaired
.

Reduced
synthesis
of
B-
as
well
as
T-lymphocytes
will
be
seen
.

The
inhibitory
effect
on
B-cell
function
can
be
observed
both
as
decreased
serum
levels
of
immunoglobulins
and
as
impaired
binding
of
antibodies
and
complement
to
the
cellular
surface
.

Reduced
T-cell
function
indicated
by
impaired
stimulation
by
PHA
and
porkweed
as
well
as
by
impaired
lymphokinin
effects
on
leukocyte
migration
inhibition
has
been
reported
.

Reduced
lymphocyte
adherence
to
antigen
and
suppressed
lymphocyte
reaction
have
also
been
observed
.

Humoral
factors
involved
in
chemotaxis
,
opsonisation
,
phagocytosis
,
vascular
permeability
leading
to
leakage
of
fluid
and
cells
and
factors
involved
in
lysis
of
antigens
are
impaired
.

This
can
be
explained
partly
by
the
observed
reduced
complement
activation
via
the
alternative
as
well
as
the
classical
pathway
in
association
with
HDC
therapy
.

Acute
processes
with
increased
vascular
permeability
and
accumulation
of
leukocytes
as
impairing
factors
could
be
influenced
beneficially
by
HDC
therapy
.

This
positive
effect
can
be
seen
in
treatment
of
septic
shock
or
rejection
of
a
transplant
.

However
,
if
sepsis
or
rejection
is
not
rapidly
reversed
,
complications
such
as
multisystem
organ
failure
and
bacteremia
are
prone
to
appear
.

Identification
of
human
leukemic
glucocorticoid
receptors
using
affinity
labeling
and
anti-human
glucocorticoid
receptor
antibodies
.

Antisera
raised
against
human
lymphoid
glucocorticoid
receptors
were
used
in
combination
with
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
affinity
label
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
21-mesylate
[
(
3H
]
DM
)
to
identify
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
of
the
human
B-lymphoblastoid
cell
line
IM-9
and
the
human
T-cell
leukemic
cell
line
CEM-C7
.

Antisera
were
obtained
following
immunization
of
New
Zealand
White
rabbits
with
[
3H
]
triamcinolone
acetonide
[
(
3H
]
TA
)
-glucocorticoid
receptor
complexes
partially
purified
by
two-stage
DNA-cellulose
chromatography
.

The
presence
of
anti-human
glucocorticoid
receptor
antibodies
was
verified
by
:
(
a
)
adsorption
of
[
3H
]
TA-receptor-antibody
complexes
to
Protein
A
;
(
b
)
a
shift
to
higher
apparent
molecular
weight
in
the
elution
position
from
Sephacryl
S300
of
[
3H
]
TA-receptor
complexes
incubated
with
immune
serum
;
and
(
c
)
the
ability
of
immune
serum
to
displace
[
3H
]
TA-receptor
complexes
on
sucrose
gradients
.

These
antibodies
also
recognized
rat
liver
and
murine
S49
cell
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

Sodium
dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
of
[
3H
]
DM-labeled
IM-9
cytosol
identified
a
major
competable
band
with
a
molecular
weight
of
approximately
90
,
000
,
three
minor
competable
components
with
molecular
weights
of
approximately
78
,
000
,
approximately
51
,
000
,
and
approximately
38
,
500
,
and
at
least
21
other
noncompetable
components
.

Following
immunoprecipitation
of
[
3H
]
DM-labeled
cytosol
with
immune
serum
,
only
the
Mr
90
,
000
and
78
,
000
components
were
seen
.

Sodium
dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
of
[
3H
]
DM-labeled
CEM-C7
cytosol
revealed
a
larger
number
of
[
3H
]
DM-labeled
components
.

However
,
after
immunoprecipitation
of
[
3H
]
DM-labeled
CEM-C7
cytosol
,
a
predominant
competable
component
with
a
molecular
weight
of
90
,
000
was
easily
identified
.

This
component
was
markedly
diminished
when
cytosols
from
the
glucocorticoid
receptor-deficient
cell
line
ICR-27
were
used
.

Thus
,
the
combination
of
affinity
labeling
and
anti-human
glucocorticoid
receptor
antibodies
is
capable
of
providing
direct
physical
identification
of
human
lymphoid
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

Effect
of
thymosin
on
glucocorticoid
receptor
activity
and
glucocorticoid
sensitivity
of
human
thymocytes
.

Incubation
with
thymosin
fraction
5
,
(
TMS
F5
at
300
micrograms/ml
)
a
partially
purified
thymic
factor
,
reduced
the
steroid
binding
activity
of
human
infant
thymocytes
from
9.6
+/-
2.1
fmole/ml
to
5.0
+/-
2.0
fmole/ml
.

The
glucocorticoid
receptor
activity
in
normal
infant
thymocytes
was
found
to
be
2
,
146
+/-
726
(
s.d.
)
sites
per
cell
with
dissociation
constant
of
1.4
+/-
0.6
X
10
(
-8
)
M
.

TMS
F5
also
increased
the
resistance
of
human
thymocytes
to
the
cytolytic
effect
of
dexamethasone
(
2.5
X
10
(
-8
)
M
)
to
168.6
+/-
30.2
%
of
control
(
P
less
than
0.01
)
.

In
animals
,
medullary
and
peripheral
blood
T
cells
are
more
resistant
to
glucocorticoids
than
immature
thymic
T
cells
.

The
results
show
that
thymosin
can
induce
changes
consistent
with
differentiation
in
human
thymocytes
.

These
in
vitro
results
are
consistent
with
a
physiological
role
of
thymosin
in
intrathymic
T
cell

Effects
of
chronic
glucocorticoid
excess
in
man
on
insulin
binding
to
circulating
cells
:
differences
between
endogenous
and
exogenous
hypercorticism
.

We
measured
[
125I
]
insulin
binding
to
circulating
monocytes
or
erythrocytes
from
16
patients
with
chronic
glucocorticoid
excess
,
9
chronically
treated
with
prednisone
and
7
with
adrenocortical
hyperfunction
.

With
monocytes
,
[
125I
]
insulin
binding
was
iincreased
in
all
patients
.

Analysis
of
binding
data
indicated
that
increased
binding
in
patients
treated
with
prednisone
was
due
to
an
ncrease
in
receptor
concentration
,
whereas
in
patients
with
adrenocortical
hyperfunction
,
it
was
due
to
an
increase
in
receptor
affinity
.

With
erythrocytes
from
patients
with
adrenocortical
hyperfunction
there
was
an
increase
in
receptor
affinity
and
a
decrease
in
receptor
concentration
,
so
that
the
binding
of
[
125I
]
insulin
was
normal
.

The
disparity
of
results
between
endogenous
and
exogenous
hypercorticism
,
between
the
two
cell
types
,
and
between
the
present
studies
and
previous
studies
suggest
that
the
effects
of
glucocorticoid
excess
on
the
insulin
receptor
are
extremely
complex
and
wide-ranging
and
that
in
this
condition
,
extrapolations
in
humans
from
data
with
circulating
cells
to
liver
and
muscle
may
not
be
appropriate
.

Reduced
level
of
cellular
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
patients
with
anorexia

.

Specific
glucocorticoid
receptors
were
measured
in
circulating
mononuclear
leukocytes
from
12
patients
with
anorexia
nervosa
and
21
healthy
control
subjects
.

Cells
from
patients
were
found
to
contain
a
significantly
(
p
less
than
0.01
)
lower
level
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
3830
+/-
210
sites/cell
,
mean
+/-
SE
)
than
those
from
controls
(
4930
+/-
250
sites/cell
)
.

A
partial
glucocorticoid
receptor
defect
may
well
explain
the
abnormal
cortisol
metabolism
and
glucocorticoid
resistance
commonly
found
in
patients
with

Regulation
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
in
human
lymphocytes
.

The
presence
of
a
glucocorticoid
receptor
in
human
lymphocytes
is
well
established
,
but
factors
affecting
its
regulation
have
not
been
described
.

Using
a
competitive
binding
whole
cell
assay
,
we
have
examined
the
binding
of
[
3H
]
-dexamethasone
at
24
and
37
degrees
C
in
untreated
normal
subjects
and
in
healthy
subjects
taking
various
glucocorticoid
preparations
.

At
24
degrees
C
normal
human
lymphocytes
had
6000
binding
sites/cell
and
a
dissociation
constant
of
4
x
10
(
-9
)
M
.

The
administration
of
1
mg
of
dexamethasone
,
5
mg
of
prednisone
,
and
37.5
mg
of
cortisone
acetate
resulted
in
a
30
%
decrease
in
binding
sites
after
1
week
with
no
change
in
binding
affinity
.

No
changes
in
the
number
of
binding
sites
was
noted
before
1
week
and
the
diminished
number
persisted
for
1
week
after
discontinuation
of
glucocorticoid
treatment
.

Lymphocytes
from
hospitalized
patients
taking
40-60
mg
of
dexamethasone
daily
demonstrated
the
same
change
in
number
of
binding
sites
that
was
seen
in
normal
subjects
taking
1
mg
of
dexamethasone
.

When
binding
assays
were
carried
out
at
physiologic
temperature
there
was
the
same
decrease
in
number
of
binding
sites
after
dexamethasone
administration
,
and
in
addition
,
there
was
a
two-fold
increase
in
binding
affinity
.

Glucocorticoid
administration
results
in
a
time-dependent
decrease
in
the
number
of
lymphocyte
glucocorticoid
binding
sites
that
is
independent
of
the
type
of
glucocorticoid
administered
.

This
is
the
first
in
vivo
demonstration
that
glucocorticoids
modulate
their
own
receptors
in
man

Immunoglobulin
localization

benign
and
malignant
lesions
of
the
human
mammary
gland
.

Using
direct
imunofluorescence
,
lesions
from
266
human
breast
specimens
were
studied
for
the
presence
of
IgA
,
IgM
,
or
IgG
localization
.

The
lesions
included
benign
elements
from
66
subcutaneous
mastectomy
specimens
in
which
the
absence
of
simultaneous
breast
malignancy
was
documented
,
primary
breast
carcinomas
from
153
mastectomy
specimens
,
and
47
biopsies
containing
metastatic
breast
cancer
.

A
statistically
significant
association
of
IgA
and
IgM
with
benign
lesions
was
contrasted
to
the
association
of
IgG
with
malignant
lesions
.

In
both
primary
and
metastatic
lesions
,
IgG
localization
was
associated
with
estrogen-receptor-poor
primary
cancers
as
compared
with
estrogen-receptor-rich
primary
cancers
.

Among
primary
breast
cancer
patients
,
IgG
localization
in
the
tumor
correlated
with
relative
lymphopenia
.

A
shorter
disease-free
interval
was
noted
in
association
with
IgG
localization
among
the
metastatic
breast
lesions
.

No
statistically
significant
association
between
stage
of
disease
and
immunoglobulin
presence
was
demonstrable
.

Moderate-to-severe
intraductal
epithelial
hyperplasias
were
more
often
associated
with
immunoglobulin

that
were
other
benign

Cancer
of
the
breast
is
the
most
common
tumor
in
females
in
Singapore
,
with
the
rate
of
20.7
per
100

)
,
which
is
predicted
to
increase
to

000
women
per

by
1995
.

A
detailed
histopathologic
review
of
50
primary
breast
cancer
tumors
analyzed
for
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
level
was
carried
out
and
a
variety
of
morphologic
features
correlated
with
ER
results
to
identify
any
factors
that
will
improve
the
management
and
prognosis
for
breast
cancer
.

Cytosol
was
incubated
with
3H-estradiol
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
cold
diethylstilbestrol
,
and
bound
and
free
hormone
were
separated
by
Dextran-coated
charcoal
method
.

Tumors
binding
more
than
5
fmol/mg
cytosol
protein
were
classified
as
ER
-positive
.

Progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
level
was
analyzed
in
some
specimens
with
the
use
of
a
similar
method
.

Most
of
the
patients
were
Chinese
(
90
%
)
.

Three
patients
were
Malays
,
one
was
Indian
,
and
one
was
European
in
this
series
.

Results
indicated
that
there
was
strong
correlation
between
ER
level
,
age
,
and
histologic
grade
of
the
tumors
.

No
correlation
existed
between
absence
or
presence
of
lymph
node
metastases
and
ER
.

Although
there
was
a
trend
for
ER
-positive
tumors
to
have
a
low-grade
lymphocytic
infiltration
,
the
difference
was
not
statistically
significant

Mononuclear

,
monocytes
,
NK
cells
and
major
histocompatibility
antigens
(
HLA-A
,

;
Ia-like
)
.

Sixty-four
per
cent
of
the
patients
had
a
moderate
or
strong
mononuclear
cell
infiltration
,
77
%
of
the
patients
without
mononuclear
cell
infiltration
had
receptors
for
estrogens
as
compared
to
51
%
of
the
patients
with
infiltration
.

The
majority
of
the
infiltrating
mononuclear
cells
were
T
cells
;
generally
the
OKT8
cells
were
predominant
.

The
Leu
3A/OKT8
cell
ratio
was
not
related
to
histological
type
,
tumor
size
,
age
of
the
patient
or
presence
of
metastases
.

Some
of
the
T
cells
had
the
Ia
antigen
and
were
thus
probably
activated
.

The
B
cells
were
either
absent
or
less
numerous
than
the
T
cells
.

There
was
no
relation
between
their
distribution
and
the
various
parameters
studied
.

A
few
monocytes
were
heterogeneous
according
to
their
markers
(
OKM
I
and
acid
phosphatase
)
.

In
6
cases
only
there
was
a
strong
infiltration
of
mononuclear
cells
positive
for
acid
phosphatase
.

The
number
of
the
natural
killer
cells
was
also
low
.

Only
a
few
mononuclear
infiltrating
cells
had
receptors
for
transferrin
.

There
was
a
positive
correlation
between
the
inflammatory
infiltration
and
the
presence
of
HLA
class-I
antigens
on
tumor
cell
s
.

Some
of
the
antisera
specific
for
lymphocyte
subsets
also
stained
the
breast
carcinoma
cells
.

The
great
variations
in
the
subsets
of
mononuclear
cells
in
breast
carcinomas
may
correspond
to
various
systems
of
defense
against
neoplasm

The
plasma
testosterone
response
to

A
study
of
the
receptors
for
dihydrotestosterone
in
fibroblasts
of
genital
and

skin
showed
a
normal
concentration
of
receptors
in

;
5-alpha-reductase
activity
in
fibroblasts
of
the
genital
skin
was
low
,
but
the

The
proliferative
response
of

was
inhibited
by
the
active
metabolite
of

D3
,
1
,
25-
(

2D3
.

To
directly
examine
the
effect
of
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
on
T
cell
activation
in
the
absence
of
other
complicating
interactions
,
we
utilized
a
panel
of
cloned
Ia-restricted
T
cell
hybridomas
that
secrete
IL
2
on
activation
by
cloned
Ia-bearing
stimulator
cells
(
TA3
)
or
when
stimulated
by
mitogen
.

Physiologic
concentrations
of
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
(
0.01
to
0.1
nm
)
inhibited
the
antigen-induced
secretion
of
IL
2
by
several
of
these
T
cell
hybridomas
.

This
inhibition
was
dependent
on
the
concentration
of
the
free
hormone
and
could
be
overcome
by
increasing
the
number
of
Ia-bearing
stimulator
cells
used
.

Pretreatment

the
T
hybridoma
but
not
the
TA3
stimulator
cell
with
1
,
25-

resulted
in
inhibition
of

.

These
results
are
consistent
with
the
finding
that
specific
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
receptors
are
present
on
the
T
cell
hybridomas
but
are
lacking
in
TA3
cells
.

1
,
25-
(

2D3
failed
,
however
,
to
inhibit
the
activation
of
the
T
cell
hybridomas
by
lectin
or
by
an
anti-Thy-1
antibody
.

These
findings
suggest
that
1
,
25-
(
OH
)
2D3
may
be
interfering
with
early
events
of
antigen-induced
T
cell
activation
,
perhaps
by
hindering
T
cell
recognition
of
the
relevant
antigen
on

prove
useful
in

to
inhibit

Glucocorticoid
receptors
and
steroid
sensitivity
in
normal
and
neoplastic
human
lymphoid
tissues
:
a
review
.

The
determination
of
estrogen
and
progesterone
receptors
in
breast
cancer
has
been
shown
to
be
useful
in
predicting
the
response
to
endocrine
therapy
.

Given
their
well-known
inhibitory
effects
on
lymphoid
tissue
,
glucocorticoids
have
been
used
widely
in
the
treatment
of
leukemia
.

Given
these
facts
,
over
the
last
10
years
,
several
investigators
have
measured
the
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
normal
and
neoplastic
lymphoid
tissue
to
see
whether
their
number
correlated
with
glucocorticoid
responsiveness
in
vitro
or
in
vivo
.

No
clear
correlation
could
be
established
between
the
level
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
and
the
in
vitro
action
of
steroids
in
normal
and
neoplastic
lymphoid
tissue
.

In
contrast
,
attempts
to
correlate
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
in
acute
lymphocytic
leukemia
to
in
vivo
steroid
responsiveness
and
immunological
type
using
the
whole-cell-binding
assay
for
receptor
determination
and
selecting
the
patients
according
to
age
and
immunological
criteria
have
been
more
successful
.

[
Glucocorticoid

Glucocorticoid
(
GC

receptors
were
studied
in
intact

from
11
donors
.

GC
binding
parameters
were
found
to
be
highly
reproducible
in
repeated
experiments
with

It
was
shown
that
GC

'
lymphocytes
could
be
distributed
into
two
different
classes
similarly
to
the
pattern
seen
in

Human

are
an

object
for
studying
genetically

,
as
well
as
by

Administration
of

10
(
6

units
of

over
a
period
of
40

The
injections
did
not
cause
local
irritation
or
inflammation
.

Fever
occurred
in
only
1
of
the
11

.

Although
several
types
of
metastases
were
monitored
,
only
skin
nodules
consistently
(
10
out
of
11
patients
)
exhibited
changes
that
were
suggestive
of
a
therapeutic
effect
of
the
treatment
regimen
:
either
a
simple
decrease
in
size
of
some
nodules
or
central

accompanied
by
an

.

NK-activity
of
peripheral

was
significantly
increased
after

of
the
first

;
the

nM
.

Lymphocytes
from
patients
with
untreated
adrenal
insufficiency
had
fewer
binding
sites
(
3364
+/-322
)
and
a
2-fold
increase
in
binding
affinity
(
5.4
+/-
0.9
mM
)
.

The
administration
of
conventional
replacement
doses
of
cortisone
acetate
for
6
months
caused
no
change
in
receptor
number
,
but
was
associated
with
a
decrease
in
binding
affinity
toward
normal
.

After
long
term
glucocorticoid
replacement
therapy
,
binding
parameters
were
similar
to
those
in
patients
before
treatment
.

The
physiological
implications
of
the
decreased

and
increased

in
adrenal

remain
to
be
elucidated
.

Glucocorticoid
receptor
concentrations
and
terminal
transferase
activity
as
indicators
of
prognosis
in
acute
non-lymphocytic
leukaemia
.

Activity
of
terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase
(
TdT
)
,
adenosine
deaminase
,
and
5'nucleotidase
and
the
cellular
concentration
of
glucocorticoid
(
dexamethasone
)
receptor
were
determined
in
25
patients
with
acute
non-lymphocytic
leukaemia
.

All
patients
were
treated
according
to
a
common
protocol
.

Increased
activity
of
TdT
(
greater
than
0.1
unit/microgram
DNA
)
was
found
in
11
patients
.

This
group
of
patients
was
shown
to
have
higher
remission
and
survival
rates
(
p
=
0.06
)
compared
with
patients
with
low
activity
of
TdT
.

The
glucocorticoid
receptor
concentration
of
the
leukaemic
blast
cells
ranged
from
0
to
0.94
fmol/microgram
DNA
.

Thirteen
patients
had
blast
cells
with
a
glucocorticoid
receptor
concentration
over
0.22
fmol/microgram
DNA
.

These
patients
had
significantly
increased
remission
and
survival
rates
(
p
=
0.006
)
compared
with
those
with
a
low
receptor
concentration
.

This
finding
can
not
be
explained
by
a
difference
in
sensitivity
to
glucocorticoids
since
these
were
not
used
as
therapeutic
agents
.

Adenosine
deaminase
and
5'nucleotidase
activities
both
varied
within
two
orders
of
magnitude
.

No
correlation
could
be
found
between
activities
of
these
enzymes
and
remission
or
survival
rate
.

These
results
show
that
measurements
of
TdT
activity
and
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
concentration
yield
valuable
prognostic
information
in
acute
non-lymphocytic
leukaemia

cortivazol
:
a
unique
high
affinity
ligand
for
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

Cortivazol
(
CVZ
)
and
deacylcortivazol
(
DAC
)
are
pyrazolosteroids
with
potent
glucocorticoid
activity
.

In
previous
work
we
showed
that
DAC
is
40-fold
more
potent
than
dexamethasone
(
DEX
)
in
lysing
leukemic
lymphoblasts
.

To
assess
the
interaction
between
these
atypical
steroids
and
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
,
we
examined
the
binding
of
[

]
CVZ
to
cytosol
from
glucocorticoid-sensitive
and
-resistant
variants
of
the
human
leukemic

In

[

CVZ
causes

induction
of
glutamine
synthetase
and
binds
to
a

.

On

,
[

from

.

CVZ
competes
for
a
97

000-dalton
protein
labeled
by

dexamethasone

.

Scatchard
analysis
of
the
binding
of
[
3H
]
CVZ
in
glucocorticoid-sensitive
cells
revealed
a
curvilinear
plot
which
resolved
into
high
(
0.4
nM
)
and
low
(
11
nM
)
affinity
components
.

The
receptor
concentration
of
the
low
affinity
site
(
0.30
pmol/mg
protein
)
was
approximately
twice
that
of
the
high

site
(
0.14
pmol/mg
protein
)
.

Dissociation
experiments
with
dilution
and/or
excess
unlabeled
CVZ
supported
the
presence
of
independent
sites
.

In
contrast
,
the
binding
of
[
3H
]
DEX
to
C7
cytosol
revealed
a
single
class
of
binding
sites
(
Kd

Examination
of
the
binding
of
[
3H

as
the

showed
that
DEX
binds
only
to

.

In
cytosol
from
a
glucocorticoid-resistant

with
virtually
no
[

binding
,
[

CVZ
detected
a

that
was
similar
in

(
0.8

and

A
controlled
pore
glass
bead
assay
for
the
measurement
of
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

An
assay
for
the
quantitation
of
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
lymphoid
tissue
has
been
developed
using
controlled
pore
glass
(
CPG
)
beads
.

Soluble
receptor
--
3H-steroid
complex
(
cytosol
or
nuclear
extract
)
is
adsorbed
quantitatively
within
the
crevasses
of
porous
glass
beads
.

Excess
labeled
steroid
as
well
as
most
non-specifically
bound
steroid
is
easily
washed
away
,
leaving
the
hormone-receptor
complex
retained
by
the
beads
.

Bound
3H-steroid
is
eluted
with
ethanol
and
measured
for
radioactivity
.

This
procedure
which
is
simple
,
rapid
,
and
highly
reproducible
is
carried
out
using
frozen
samples
(
stable
for
many
months
)
containing
as
few
as
1
X
10
(
7
)
cells
.

A
comparison
of
the
CPG
assay
to
dextran
coated
charcoal
and
a
whole
cell
assay
demonstrates
that
CPG
and
dextran
coated
charcoal
give
equivalent
measurements
of
cytosolic
receptor
concentration
,
while
the
CPG
and
whole
cell
assays
provide
equivalent
values
for
total

content
.

Plasmacytoid
blast

in
B-cell
chronic

leukemia
:
effect
of
estradiol
on
growth
and
differentiation
in
vitro
.

Evolution
of
a
case
of
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
into
blast
crisis
was
found
to
be
characterized
by
three
unusual
features
(
1
)
the
phenotype
of
the
emerging
blast
cells
was
that
of
pre-plasmacytoid
cells
as
shown
by
plasma
cell
morphology
and
an
immunological
phenotype
corresponding
partially
with
CLL-
or
intermediate
B-cells
,
partially
with
plasma
cells
(

,
polyclonal

)
;
(
2
)
cytogenetic
analysis
of
spontaneous
metaphases
revealed
that
in
addition
to
the
typical
CLL
abnormality
,
trisomy
12
,
in
all
of
the
cells
,
an
additional
translocation
between
chromosomes
14
and
17
was
present
in
40
%
with
a
presumptive
breakpoint
on
chromosome
14
(
q12-3
)
never
described
before
(
commonly
q32
)
and
(
3
)
the
progression
of
the
disease
was
associated
with
a
striking
increase
in
the
expression
by
the
transformed
cells
of
specific
binding
sites
for
estradiol
(
E2
)
due
to
an
actual
increase
in
total
cellular
receptor
proteins
and
not
to
a
change
in
receptor
affinity
for
E2
.

The
functional
status
of
the
steroid
receptors
was
confirmed
by
nuclear
transfer
of
the
cytoplasmic
hormone-receptor
complex
upon
temperature
activation
.

Since
the
rise
in
E2-receptor
display
paralleled
a
large
increase
in
the
proliferative
activity
of
the
cells
as
well
as
a
change
in
their
maturation
status
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
E2-receptor
should
be
considered
as
a
physiological
marker
of
growth
rate
or
of
cellular
differentiation
.

Exposure
of
the
patient
's
blast
cells
to
E2
in
vitro
resulted
in
cessation
of
cell
growth
following
at
least
one
mitosis
after
addition
of
the
inducer
as
seen
from
the
replacement
of
the
large
blasts
by
small
CLL-like
cells
without
definite
signs
of
alteration
of
the
differentiation
status
.

This
suggests
the
association
of
E2-receptor
expression
with
control
of
growth
rather
than
cell
maturation
.

Multiple
forms
and
fragments
of
cytosolic
glucocorticoid
receptors
from
human
leukemic
cells
and
normal
lymphocytes
.

Therapy
with
glucocorticoids
is
generally
more
effective
in
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
than
in
other
types
of
human
leukemia
.

Previous
studies
,
however
,
have
not
revealed
any
consistent
relationship
between
clinical
responsiveness
and
the
cellular
or
cytosolic
concentration
of
glucocorticoid-binding
sites
.

The
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
determine
whether
there
are
intrinsic
structural
differences
among
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
various
types
of
leukemic
cells
and
normal
lymphocytes
and
to
investigate
the
role
of
endogenous
peptidases
in
receptor
degradation
.

Cytosols
were
prepared
from
fresh
or
rapidly
frozen
leukocytes
from
6
healthy
adults
and
35
high-risk
leukemia
patients
(
median
white
blood
cell
count
,
150
,
000
cells/microliter
;
median
age
,
13
years
)
.

Receptors
were
labeled
with
[
3H
]
triamcinolone
acetonide
and
quantitated
by
charcoal-dextran
treatment
or
Sephadex
LH-20
chromatography
.

Mean
and
median
cytosolic
receptor
concentrations
in
12
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
specimens
lacking
the
standard
B-cell
or
T-cell
markers
(
``
null
cells
''
)
were
approximately
4-fold
higher
than
in
23
other
leukemic
cell
specimens
.

No
other
consistent
differences
in
receptor
content
were
observed
.

Agarose
filtration
and
ultracentrifugation
in
hypotonic
buffers
containing
20
mM
Na2MoO4
revealed
complexes
of
similar
size
and
shape
in
all
clinical
specimens
tested
and
two
established
leukemic
cell
lines
.

They
had
Stokes
radii
(
Rs
)
of
8.1
+/-
0.5
(
S.D.
)
nm
(
n
=
50
)
,
sedimentation
coefficients
of
9.5
+/-
0.3S
(
n
=
40
)
,
molecular
weights
of
approximately
330
,
000
,
and
axial
ratios
(
a/b
)
of
approximately
12
.

In
hypertonic
,
molybdate-free
buffer
,
these
oligomeric
complexes
were
dissociated
into
subunits
with
Rs
of
5.9
+/-
0.3
nm
(
n
=
12
)
and
a/b
of
11
to
12
,
as
observed
previously
for
other
receptors
.

Fragmentation
of
the
oligomer
and
the
subunit
was
evident
in
some
cytosols
.

High
activities
of
peptidases
of
various
specificities
were
detected
in
leukemic
cell
cytosols
,
as
in
other
cytosols
,
by
fluorometric
assays
with
derivatives
of
7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
.

Receptor
cleavage
by
these
and
other
endogenous
enzymes
may
account
for
previous
observations
of
``
abnormal
''
receptors
in
cytosols
from
some
leukemic
specimens
.

We
conclude
that
intrinsic
structural
defects
in
the
receptors
are
unlikely
explanations
for
the
unresponsiveness
of
some
types
of
leukemia
to
steroid
therapy
.

Glucocorticoid
receptor
number
and
intracellular
water
space
.

In
order
to
elucidate
the
relationship
between
cell
water
content
and
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
,
eleven
normal
and
malignant
lymphoid
or
myelomonocytic
cell
types
originating
from
mouse
,
rat
and
man
were
investigated
.

The
cellular
water
space
was
measured
with
3H2O
,
and
glucocorticoid
receptor
number
was
measured
in
a
whole-cell
binding
assay
with
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
at
30
and
37
degrees
C
.

The
intracellular
water
phase
concentration
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
around
40
nmol/l
cell
water
)
,
and
the
dependence
of
receptor
affinity
on
temperature
were
similar
in
normal
and
malignant
rodent
and
human
cells
.

It
is
concluded
that
comparisons
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
are
best
made
on
the
basis
of
intracellular
receptor
concentrations
.

Covalent
labeling
of
rat
thymocyte
and
human
lymphoid
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

Lymphoid
cells
contain
specific
receptors
for
glucocorticoids
.

We
have
used
[
3H
]
dexamethasone-21-mesylate
to
label
covalently
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
rat
thymic
lymphocytes
and
in
neoplastic
cells
obtained
from
patients
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
and
malignant
lymphoma
.

The
covalently
labeled
glucocorticoid
receptors
were
identified
by
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
(
in
the
presence
of
0.1
%
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate
)
.

In
cytosolic
fractions
prepared
from
rat
thymic
lymphocytes
,
[
3H
]
-dexamethasone-21-mesylate
labels
a
protein
(
Mr
approximately
equal
to
95
,
000
)
which
was
identified
as
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
by
the
following
criteria
:
(
a
)
labeling
of
this
moiety
is
inhibited
by
treatment
with
a
100-fold
molar
excess
of
glucocorticoids
,
such
as
dexamethasone
and
triamcinolone
acetonide
;
and
(
b
)
the
covalently
labeled
Mr
approximately
equal
to
95
,
000
protein
is
activated
(
by
heating
at
20
degrees
for
30
min
)
to
a
form
that
binds
to
DNA-cellulose
.

When
intact
thymocytes
are
treated
with
[
3H
]
dexamethasone-21-mesylate
,
an
Mr
approximately
equal
to
95
,
000
moiety
is
also
labeled
covalently
.

Approximately
35
%
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptors
can
be
labeled
covalently
when
intact
thymocytes
are
treated
with
100
nM
[
3H
]
dexamethasone-21-mesylate
for
30
min
at
4
degrees
.

Neoplastic
cells
from
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
and
malignant
lymphoma
were
treated
with
[
3H
]
dexamethasone-21-mesylate
.

In
all
samples
,
an
Mr
approximately
equal
to
95
,
000
moiety
was
labeled
covalently
;
labeling
was
inhibited
by
excess
glucocorticoid
.

Smaller
moieties
were
also
identified
by
competition
experiments
;
these
may
represent
proteolytic
fragments
of
the
Mr
approximately
equal
to
95
,
000
receptor
.

Thus
,
in
rat
and
human
lymphoid
cells
,
[
3H
]
dexamethasone-21-mesylate
can
be
used
to
label
covalently
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

The
association
of
cytosol
oestrogen
and
progesterone
receptors
with
histological
features
of
breast
cancer
and
early
recurrence
of
disease
.

Two
hundred
and
eighty-eight
primary
breast
tumours
were
examined
for
the
presence
or
absence
of
oestrogen
(
REc
)
and
progesterone
(
RPc
)
receptors
.

Analysis
has
shown
a
relative
interdependence
between
the
steroid
receptor
status
of
primary
breast
cancer
and
other
prognostic
variables
such
as
histological
grade
,
lymphocytic
infiltration
and
tumour
elastosis
.

There
were
significant
associations
between
epithelial
cellularity
,
stromal
fibrosis
and
the
value
of
REc
in
those
tumours
in
which
the
receptor
was
present
.

Cellularity
and
fibrosis
were
unrelated
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
oestrogen
receptor
.

By
contrast
,
neither
the
presence
or
absence
nor
the
value
of
RPc
could
be
related
to
cellularity
or
fibrosis
.

The
value
of
REc
and
RPc
analysis
as
an
indicator
of
prognosis
was
examined
in
a
sub-group
of
175
patients
receiving
no
additional
treatment
following
mastectomy
.

Overall
relapse-free
survival
(
RFS
)
was
no
different
for
those
patients
with
receptors
compared
to
those
without
them
(
REc
P
=
0.11
,
RPc
P
=
0.7
)
.

There
was
no
difference
in
RFS
of
receptor
positive
and
negative
tumours
when
the
axillary
node
status
was
taken
into
account
.

Clinical
implications
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
human
leukemia
.

Normal
lymphoid
cells
contain
glucocorticoid
receptor
.

A
variety
of
stimuli
that
activate
these
cells
also
induce
increases
in
receptor
concentration
.

Similar
glucocorticoid
receptors
can
be
detected
in
lymphoid
cells
from
patients
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
(
ALL
)
.

Absence
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
usually
found
in
treated
patients
)
predicts
lack
of
glucocorticoid
responsiveness
.

Furthermore
,
in
our
hands
,
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
correlate
with
the
duration
of
complete
remission
in
ALL
(
though
not
in
other
forms
of
leukemia
)
.

This
association
is
independent
of
cell
type
,
age
,
sex
,
or
initial
leukocyte
count
.

The
level
of
receptor
shows
a
negative
correlation
with
increasing
aggressiveness
of
the
tumor
(
null-cell
leukemia
greater
than
T-cell
leukemia
greater
than
Burkitt
's
lymphoma
)
.

Corticosteroid-mediated

Glucocorticoids
have
profound
and
complex
effects
on
the
human
immune
response
.

However
,
the
precise
mechanisms
of
the
corticosteroid-induced
immunoregulation
in
man
have
not
been
precisely
defined
.

Intracytoplasmic
corticosteroid-specific
receptors
appear
to
be
an
important
common
pathway
for
steroid-induced
changes
,
but
variations
of
receptor
parameters
do
not
account
for
the
multifaceted
effects
on
the
immune
system
.

Human
circulating
mononuclear
cells
redistribute
out
of
the
intravascular
compartment
following
treatment
with
corticosteroids
.

Although
certain
components
at
this
redistribution
phenomenon
have
been
well-characterized
,
the
importance
of
this
compartmental
cellular
shift
with
respect
to
the
mechanisms
of
corticosteroid-induced
immunoregulation
are
less
well-defined
.

Recent
observations
that
activated
lymphocytes
may
be
sensitive
to
the
lytic
effects
of
glucocorticoids
suggest
that
under
certain
situations
the
elimination
of
selected
subsets
of
cells
may
be
a
relevant
mechanism
of
corticosteroid-mediated
immunoregulation
in
man
.

Corticosteroid-mediated
effects
on
monocyte
function
may
be
an
important
mechanism
of
drug-induced
immunoregulation
in
monocyte-dependent
responses
.

In
some
experimental
conditions
,
corticosteroids
inhibit
Interleukin
1
production
by
monocytes
.

The
immunoregulatory
effects
of
corticosteroids
on
lymphocyte
immune
responses
are
complex
.

In
vitro
corticosteroids
appear
to
selectively
affect
early
immunoregulatory
events
as
opposed
to
altering
an
established
response
.

Multiple
sites
of
steroid-induced
modulations
of
human
B
cell
responses
have
been
defined
.

The
glucocorticoid
binding
properties
of
18
human
lymphoid
cell
lines
(
HLCL
)
have
been
investigated
.

The
specificity
of
steroid
binding
was
confirmed
with
various
glucocorticoid
agonists
and
antagonists
.

A
gradation
in
whole
cell
and
cytoplasmic
glucocorticoid
binding
capacity
was
observed
in
the
different
cell
line
types
:
lymphoblastoid
greater
than
lymphoma
greater
than
leukaemia
.

The
cytoplasmic
receptors
of
leukaemia
and
lymphoblastoid
lines
appeared
to
contain
both
proteinaceous
and
phospholipid
components
.

Cytoplasmic
steroid-receptor
complexes
exhibited
a
wide
range
of
sedimentation
coefficients
(
8.5-11.3S
)
in
low
ionic
strength
buffer
but
there
was
no
correlation
with
cell
line
type
or
glucocorticoid
sensitivity
.

Activation
of
these
complexes
by
heat
(
37
degrees
C
)
or
exposure
to
high
ionic
strength
buffer
(
0.3
M
NaCl
)
induced
nuclear
binding
of
steroid
but
only
complexes
in
high
ionic
strength
buffer
manifested
changes
in
sedimentation
coefficient
.

No
correlation
was
observed
between
the
level
or
nature
of
glucocorticoid
binding
and
the
cytolethal
or
cytostatic
responsiveness
of
HLCL
to
glucocorticoid
treatment
in
vitro
.

The
resistance
to
cytolethal
effects
can
not
be
ascribed
to
a
failure
of
cells
to
take
up
and
bind
steroid
or
to
significant
differences
in
the
molecular
species
of
cytoplasmic
receptors
present
.

CD28
-mediated
activation
in
CD45RA+
and
CD45RO+
T
cells
:
enhanced
levels
of
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
and
c-Rel
nuclear
translocation
in
CD45RA+
cells
.

We
have
analyzed
the
effect
of
complete
T
cell
activation
(
anti-CD3
plus
anti-CD28
)
on
the
activation
of
NF-kappaB
in
CD45RA+
(
naive
)
and
CD45RO+
(
memory/effector
)
T
cells
.

Long
exposure
(
24
h
)
induced
stronger
NF-kappaB
DNA
binding
in
CD45RA+
cells
than
in
CD45RO+
cells
.

Analysis
of
the
nuclear
c-Rel
protein
indicated
that
after
anti-CD3+anti-CD28
stimulation
the
level
of
c-Rel
was
higher
in
CD45RA+
cells
.

Analysis
of
the
cytoplasmic
inhibitor
IkappaBalpha
indicated
that
anti-CD3+anti-CD28
stimulation
induced
a
long-lasting
degradation
in
CD45RA+
cells
but
in
CD45RO+
cells
the
degradation
process
was
more
rapid
.

Because
the
CD28
costimulus
is
known
to
induce
the
production
of
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
(
ROIs
)
,
the
intracellular
ROI
levels
in
CD45RA+
and
CD45RO+
cells
were
compared
by
flow
cytometry
.

ROIs
were
produced
in
both
cell
types
,
but
more
strongly
in
CD45RA+
cells
.

The
data
presented
in
this
study
further
emphasize
the
differences
between
CD45RA+
and
CD45RO+
T
lymphocytes
in
ROI-dependent
signaling
pathways
.

Ikaros
in
hemopoietic
lineage
determination
and
homeostasis
.

Studies
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
control
hemopoietic
differentiation
have
focused
on
signaling
cascades
and
nuclear
effectors
that
drive
this
complex
developmental
system
in
a
regulated
fashion
.

Here
we
review
the
role
of
Ikaros
,
the
founding
member
of
a
unique
family
of
zinc
finger
transcription
factors
in
this
developmental
process
.

Studies
on
an
Ikaros
null
mutation
have
revealed
an
essential
role
for
this
factor
in
lymphoid
cell
fate
determination
and
at
subsequent
branch
points
of
the
T
cell
differentiation
pathway
.

Differences
in
the
phenotypes
of
a
null
and
a
dominant
negative
(
DN
)
Ikaros
mutation
provide
insight
into
a
regulatory
network
through
which
Ikaros
proteins
exert
their
effects
in
development
.

In
addition
a
comparative
analysis
of
the
hemopoietic
stem
cell
and
precursor
compartment
resulting
from
the
two
Ikaros
mutations
reveals
a
profound
yet
not
absolute
requirement
for
Ikaros
in
the
production
and
differentiation
of
these
populations
.

Overexpression
of
p65
and
c-Jun
substitutes
for
B7-1
costimulation
by
targeting
the
CD28RE
within
the
IL-2
promoter
.

The
role
of
Rel
and
activation
protein-1
(
AP-1
)
in
IL-2
promoter
activity
in
B7-1-
and
leukocyte
function-associated
Ag-3
(
LFA.
3
)
-costimulated
T
cells
has
been
evaluated
.

We
demonstrate
that
overexpression
of
c-Jun
but
not
c-Fos
increases
IL-2
promoter
activity
in
both
B7-1-
and
LFA-3-costimulated
Jurkat
T
cells
.

Cotransfection
of
both
c-Jun
and
c-Fos
substitutes
for
B7-1
costimulation
in
driving
an
activation
protein-1
response
element
but
not
for
the
IL-2
promoter
.

Overexpression
of
Rel
proteins
demonstrated
that
p65-expressing
Jurkat
cells
transcribed
equally
well
a
nuclear
factor
kappabeta
reporter
construct
when
costimulated
with
B7-1
or
LFA-3
,
but
transcription
of
IL-2
promoter
or
CD28
response
element
(
CD28RE
)
-driven
reporters
was
superior
in
B7-1-costimulated
cells
.

Combined
expression
of
c-Jun
and
p65
induced
vigorous
transcription
of
IL-2
promoter-
and
CD28RE-driven
reporter
constructs
in
both
LFA-3-
and
B7-1-costimulated
Jurkat
cells
.

Mutating
the
CD28RE
but
not
the
upstream
nuclear
factor
kappabeta-binding
site
in
the
IL-2
promoter
reduced
B7-1
-driven
transcription
>
90
%
.

The
results
implicates
a
major
role
of
the
CD28RE
in
the
integration
of
p65
/
c-Jun
-mediated
transcription
within
the
IL-2
promoter
.

We
suggest
that
the
transition
from
an
autocrine
LFA-3
-driven
immune
response
to
a
B7
--
induced
paracrine
immune
response
involves
the
activation
of
c-Jun
and
p65
,
which
target
the
CD28RE
region
of
the
IL-2
promoter
.

Defects
in
actin-cap
formation
in
Vav-deficient
mice
implicate
an
actin
requirement
for
lymphocyte
signal
transduction
.

BACKGROUND
:
Antigen-receptor
interactions
on
lymphocytes
result
in
local
clustering
of
actin
,
receptors
and
signaling
molecules
into
an
asymmetric
membrane
structure
termed
a
cap
.

Although
actin
polymerization
is
known
to
be
required
,
the
mechanisms
underlying
cap
formation
are
unclear
.

We
have
studied
the
events
underlying
cap
formation
using
mice
bearing
a
null
mutation
in
vav
(
vav
-/-
)
,
a
gene
that
encodes
a
guanine-nucleotide
exchange
factor
for
the
GTPase
Rac
.

RESULTS
:
Lymphocytes
from
vav
-/-
mice
failed
to
form
T-cell
receptor
caps
following
activation
and
had
a
defective
actin
cytoskeleton
.

The
vav-/-
T
cells
were
deficient
in
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
production
and
proliferation
,
and
the
peak
of
Ca2+
mobilization
was
reduced
although
of
normal
duration
.

Activation
of
Jun
N-terminal
kinase
or
stress-activated
kinase
(
JNK
or
SAPK
)
and
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
and
the
induction
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-ATc1
and
egr-1
genes
was
normal
.

Despite
the
reduced
Ca2+
mobilization
,
translocation
of
cytoplasmic
NF-ATc
to
the
nucleus
was
normal
,
reflecting
that
the
lower
levels
of
Ca2+
in
vav-/-
cells
were
still
sufficient
to
activate
calcineurin
.

Treatment
of
lymphocytes
with
cytochalasin
D
,
which
blocks
actin
polymerization
,
inhibited
cap
formation
and
produced
defects
in
signaling
and
IL-2
transcriptional
induction
in
response
to
antigen-receptor
signaling
that
were
nearly
identical
to
those
seen
in
vav-/-
cells
.

In
transfection
studies
,
either
constitutively
active
Vav
or
Rac
could
complement
constitutively
active
calcineurin
to
activate
NF-AT-dependent
transcription
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
results
indicate
that
Vav
is
required
for
cap
formation
in
lymphocytes
.

Furthermore
,
the
correlation
between
cap
formation
,
IL-2
production
and
proliferation
supports
the
hypothesis
that
an
actin-dependent
pathway
is
a
source
of
specialized
growth
regulatory
signals
.

CD14
-dependent
activation
of
human
endothelial
cells
by
Bacteroides
fragilis
outer
membrane
.

We
studied
the
capacity
of
isolated
Bacteriodes
fragilis
outer
membrane
,
B.
fragilis
NCTC9343
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
;
endotoxin
)
,
and
B.
fragilis
NCTC9343
capsular
polysaccharides
to
activate
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cell
(
HUVEC
)
monolayers
.

To
assess
HUVEC
activation
,
E-selectin
expression
was
measured
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
,
Northern
blot
analysis
for
E-selectin-specific
mRNA
,
and
electrophoretic
gel
mobility
shift
assay
(
EMSA
)
for
NF-kappa
B
,
a
transcription
factor
necessary
for
E-selectin
gene
activation
.

Exposure
of
HUVECs
to
B.
fragilis
outer
membrane
fractions
,
separated
from
other
components
of
the
B.
fragilis
cell
wall
by
isopycnic
,
sucrose
gradient
centrifugation
,
significantly
increased
surface
expression
of
E-selectin
and
induced
functional
endothelial
cell
-dependent
leukocyte
adhesion
.

B.
fragilis
outer
membranes
induced
translocation
of
NF-kappa
B
to
HUVEC
nuclei
and
accumulation
of
E-selectin
mRNA
in
HUVEC
cytoplasm
.

E-selectin
expression
induced
by
B.
fragilis
outer
membranes
was
not
blocked
by
polymixin
B
.

In
contrast
,
E-selectin
expression
induced
by
outer
membrane
fractions
purified
from
E.
coli
was
competitively
inhibited
by
polymixin
B
.

Neither
purified
B.
fragilis
LPS
,
a
prominent
constituent
of
the
outer
membrane
,
nor
purified
B.
fragilis
capsular
polysaccharides
induced
HUVEC
activation
.

Two
different
monoclonal
antibodies
directed
against
human
CD14
completely
inhibited
B.
fragilis
outer
membrane-induced
NF-kappa
B
activation
,
E-selectin
transcription
,
and
E-selectin
surface
expression
.

We
conclude
that
the
outer
membrane
component
of
the
B.
fragilis
cell
wall
contains
a
proinflammatory
factor
(
s
)
,
that
is
not
LPS
,
which
induces
human
endothelial
cell
activation
by
a
soluble
CD14
-dependent
mechanism
.

NF-kappaB
protects
HIV-1-infected
myeloid
cells
from
apoptosis
.

HIV-1
infection
of
primary
monocytic
cells
and
myeloid
cell
lines
results
in
sustained
NF-kappaB
activation
.

Recently
,
NF-kappaB
induction
has
been
shown
to
play
a
role
in
protecting
cells
from
programmed
cell
death
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
sought
to
investigate
whether
constitutive
NF-kappaB
activity
in
chronically
HIV-1-infected
promonocytic
U937
(
U9-IIIB
)
and
myeloblastic
PLB-985
(
PLB-IIIB
)
cells
affects
apoptotic
signaling
.

TNFalpha
and
cycloheximide
caused
infected
cells
to
undergo
apoptosis
more
rapidly
than
parental
U937
and
PLB-985
cells
.

Inhibition
of
TNFalpha
-induced
NF-kappaB
activation
using
the
antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine
(
NAC
)
resulted
in
increased
apoptosis
in
both
U937
and
U9-IIIB
cells
,
while
preactivation
of
NF-kappaB
with
the
non-apoptotic
inducer
IL-1beta
caused
a
relative
decrease
in
apoptosis
.

Inhibition
of
constitutive
NF-kappaB
activity
in
U9-IIIB
and
PLB-IIIB
cells
also
induced
apoptosis
,
suggesting
that
NF-kappaB
protects
cells
from
a
persistent
apoptotic
signal
.

TNFalpha
plus
NAC
treatment
resulted
in
a
marked
decrease
in
Bcl-2
protein
levels
in
HIV-1-infected
cells
,
coupled
with
an
increase
in
Bax
protein
compared
to
uninfected
cells
,
suggesting
that
the
difference
in
susceptibility
to
TNFalpha
-induced
apoptosis
may
relate
to
the
differences
in
relative
levels
of
Bcl-2
and
Bax
.

The
protective
role
of
NF-kappaB
in
blocking
TNFalpha-
and
HIV-1-induced
apoptosis
was
supported
by
studies
in
Jurkat
T
cells
engineered
to
express
IkappaB
alpha
repressor
mutants
(
TD-IkappaB
)
under
the
control
of
a
tetracycline-responsive
promoter
.

Cells
underwent
apoptosis
in
response
to
TNFalpha
only
when
NF-kappaB
activation
was
inhibited
by
TD-IkappaB
expression
.

As
was
observed
for
the
U9-IIIB
cells
,
TNFalpha
treatment
also
induced
a
marked
decrease
in
Bcl-2
protein
levels
in
TD-IkappaB
expressing
cells
.

These
experiments
demonstrate
that
apoptotic
signaling
is
perturbed
in
HIV-1-infected
U9-IIIB
cells
and
indicate
that
NF-kappaB
activation
may
play
an
additional
protective
role
against
HIV-1-induced
apoptosis
in
myeloid
cells
.

Human
normal
peripheral
blood
B-lymphocytes
are
deficient
in
DNA-dependent
protein
kinase
activity
due
to
the
expression
of
a
variant
form
of
the
Ku86
protein
.

The
heterodimeric
Ku
protein
,
which
comprises
a
86
kDa
(
Ku86
)
amd
a
70
kDa
(
Ku70
)
subunits
,
is
an
abundant
nuclear
DNA-binding
protein
which
binds
in
vitro
to
DNA
termini
without
sequence
specificity
.

Ku
is
the
DNA-targeting
component
of
the
large
catalytic
sub-unit
of
the
DNA-dependent
protein
kinase
complex
(
DNA-PK
[
CS
]
)
,
that
plays
a
critical
role
in
mammalian
double-strand
break
repair
and
lymphoid
V
(
D
)
J
recombination
.

By
using
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
,
we
demonstrated
that
in
addition
to
the
major
Ku
x
DNA
complex
usually
detected
in
cell
line
extracts
,
a
second
complex
with
faster
electrophoretic
mobility
was
observed
in
normal
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
(
PBL
)
extracts
.

The
presence
of
this
faster
migrating
complex
was
restricted
to
B
cells
among
the
circulating
lymphocyte
population
.

Western
blot
analysis
revealed
that
B
cells
express
a
variant
form
of
the
Ku86
protein
with
an
apparent
molecular
weight
of
69
kDa
,
and
not
the
86
kDa-
full-length
protein
.

Although
the
heterodimer
Ku70/variant-Ku86
binds
to
DNA-ends
,
this
altered
form
of
the
Ku
heterodimer
has
a
decreased
ability
to
recruit
the
catalytic
component
of
the
complex
,
DNA-PK
(
CS
)
,
which
contributes
to
an
absence
of
detectable
DNA-PK
activity
in
B
cells
.

These
data
provide
a
molecular
basis
for
the
increased
sensitivity
of
B
cells
to
ionizing
radiation
and
identify
a
new
mechanism
of
regulation
of
DNA-PK
activity
that
operates
in
vivo
.

Co-stimulation
of
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
with
IL-2
and
anti-CD3
monoclonal
antibodies
induces
phosphorylation
of
CREB
.

Phosphorylation
of
the
cAMP-response
element
binding
protein
CREB
within
1
h
of
CD2
but
not
CD3
cross-linking
of
human
PBMC
was
recently
demonstrated
.

The
absence
of
P-CREB
following
CD3
cross-linking
was
unexpected
,
as
other
laboratories
reported
increased
phosphorylation
of
CREB
following
CD3
cross-linking
of
the
Jurkat
lymphocyte
cell
line
.

Due
to
Jurkat
T-cells
being
IL-2-independent
,
it
was
postulated
that
IL-2
might
provide
a
necessary
co-stimulus
for
phosphorylation
of
CREB
in
primary
lymphocytes
.

Therefore
,
P-CREB
was
evaluated
following
co-stimulation
of
human
PBMC
through
the
IL-2
and
CD2
or
CD3
receptors
.

IL-2
did
not
further
augment
phosphorylation
of
CREB
following
CD2
cross-linking
.

However
,
while
neither
IL-2
nor
CD3
cross-linking
alone
induced
P-CREB
,
a
4.5-fold
increase
in
phosphorylation
of
CREB
within
1
h
of
IL-2/CD3
co-stimulation
was
observed
.

Phosphorylation
was
not
associated
with
the
induction
of
cAMP
,
and
inhibition
of
PKA
signaling
had
no
effect
on
P-CREB
.

Consistent
with
signal
transduction
through
p56lck
or
p59fyn
,
inhibition
of
PTK
signaling
reduced
phosphorylation
50
%
.

Interestingly
,
inhibiting
PKC
signaling
with
calphostin
C
further
increased
P-CREB
levels
3-fold
over
that
observed
in
IL-2/CD3
co-stimulated
cells
not
pretreated
with
a
PKC
inhibitor
.

In
contrast
to
previous
studies
performed
in
the
absence
of
exogenous
IL-2
,
no
increase
in
binding
of
CREB
to
a
32P-labeled
oligonucleotide
probe
was
observed
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
IL-2
and
CD3
signaling
pathways
provide
a
necessary
and
co-operative
stimulus
promoting
phosphorylation
of
CREB
following
receptor
cross-linking

HIV-1
infection
induces
a
selective
reduction
in
STAT5
protein
expression
.

HIV-1
infection
is
accompanied
by
qualitative
and
quantitative
defects
in
CD4+
T
lymphocytes
.

Loss
of
immune
function
in
HIV
patients
is
usually
associated
with
a
profound
dysregulation
of
cytokine
production
.

To
investigate
whether
cytokine
signaling
defects
occur
during
HIV
infection
,
PHA
blasts
from
healthy
human
donors
were
infected
with
two
strains
of
HIV-1
and
screened
for
the
expression
of
STAT
proteins
used
in
cytokine
signaling
.

A
selective
decrease
in
STAT5B
was
seen
8
days
after
infection
with
the
BZ167
dual-tropic
HIV
isolate
,
but
not
with
the
Ba-L
,
M-tropic
strain
.

Based
on
these
findings
,
purified
T
cells
from
HIV-infected
patients
in
different
stages
of
disease
were
also
tested
for
STAT
expression
;
decreases
in
STAT5A
,
STAT5B
,
and
STAT1alpha
were
observed
in
all
patients
.

The
reduction
in
STATs
seen
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
after
HIV
infection
may
contribute
to
the
loss
of
T
cell
function
in
HIV
disease
.

Transcription
factors
that
regulate
monocyte
/
macrophage
differentiation
.

Although
all
the
cells
in
an
organism
contain
the
same
genetic
information
,
differences
in
the
cell
phenotype
arise
from
the
expression
of
lineage-specific
genes
.

During
myelopoiesis
,
external
differentiating
signals
regulate
the
expression
of
a
set
of
transcription
factors
.

The
combined
action
of
these
transcription
factors
subsequently
determines
the
expression
of
myeloid-specific
genes
and
the
generation
of
monocytes
and
macrophages
.

In
particular
,
the
transcription
factor
PU.1
has
a
critical
role
in
this
process
.

We
review
the
contribution
of
several
transcription
factors
to
the
control
of
macrophage
development

Transcription
factor
LKLF
is
sufficient
to
program
T
cell
quiescence
via
a
c-Myc
--
dependent
pathway
.

T
lymphocytes
circulate
in
a
quiescent
state
until
they
encounter
cognate
antigen
bound
to
the
surface
of
an
antigen-presenting
cell
.

The
molecular
pathways
that
regulate
T
cell
quiescence
remain
largely
unknown
.

Here
we
show
that
forced
expression
of
the
lung
Kruppel-like
transcription
factor
(
LKLF
)
in
Jurkat
T
cells
is
sufficient
to
program
a
quiescent
phenotype
characterized
by
decreased
proliferation
,
reduced
cell
size
and
protein
synthesis
and
decreased
surface
expression
of
activation
markers
.

Conversely
,
LKLF-deficient
peripheral
T
cells
produced
by
gene
targeting
showed
increased
proliferation
,
increased
cell
size
and
enhanced
expression
of
surface
activation
markers
in
vivo
.

LKLF
appeared
to
function
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
decreasing
expression
of
the
proto-oncogene
encoding
c-Myc
.

Forced
expression
of
LKLF
was
associated
with
markedly
decreased
c-Myc
expression
.

In
addition
,
many
effects
of
LKLF
expression
were
mimicked
by
expression
of
the
dominant-negative
MadMyc
protein
and
rescued
by
overexpression
of
c-Myc
.

Thus
,
LKLF
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
to
program
quiescence
in
T
cells
and
functions
,
in
part
,
by
negatively
regulating
a
c-Myc
--
dependent
pathway
.

HTLV-1
p12
(
I
)
protein
enhances
STAT5
activation
and
decreases
the
interleukin-2
requirement
for
proliferation
of
primary
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
.

The
p12
(
I
)
protein
,
encoded
by
the
pX
open
reading
frame
I
of
the
human
T-lymphotropic
virus
type
1
(
HTLV-1
)
,
is
a
hydrophobic
protein
that
localizes
to
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
the
Golgi
.

Although
p12
(
I
)
contains
4
minimal
proline-rich
,
src
homology
3-binding
motifs
(
PXXP
)
,
a
characteristic
commonly
found
in
proteins
involved
in
signaling
pathways
,
it
has
not
been
known
whether
p12
(
I
)
has
a
role
in
modulating
intracellular
signaling
pathways
.

This
study
demonstrated
that
p12
(
I
)
binds
to
the
cytoplasmic
domain
of
the
interleukin-2
receptor
(
IL-2R
)
beta
chain
that
is
involved
in
the
recruitment
of
the
Jak1
and
Jak3
kinases
.

As
a
result
of
this
interaction
,
p12
(
I
)
increases
signal
transducers
and
activators
of
transcription
5
(
STAT5
)
DNA
binding
and
transcriptional
activity
and
this
effect
depends
on
the
presence
of
both
IL-2R
beta
and
gamma
(
c
)
chains
and
Jak3
.

Transduction
of
primary
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
with
a
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1-based
retroviral
vector
expressing
p12
(
I
)
also
resulted
in
increased
STAT5
phosphorylation
and
DNA
binding
.

However
,
p12
(
I
)
could
increase
proliferation
of
human
PBMCs
only
after
stimulation
of
T-cell
receptors
by
treatment
of
cells
with
low
concentrations
of
alphaCD3
and
alphaCD28
antibodies
.

In
addition
,
the
proliferative
advantage
of
p12
(
I
)
-transduced
PBMCs
was
evident
mainly
at
low
concentrations
of
IL-2
.

Together
,
these
data
indicate
that
p12
(
I
)
may
confer
a
proliferative
advantage
on
HTLV-1-infected
cells
in
the
presence
of
suboptimal
antigen
stimulation
and
that
this
event
may
account
for
the
clonal
proliferation
of
infected
T
cells
in
vivo
.

Single
dose
intranasal
administration
of
retinal
autoantigen
generates
a
rapid
accumulation
and
cell
activation
in
draining
lymph
node
and
spleen
:
implications
for
tolerance
therapy
.

BACKGROUND/AIMS
:
A
single
intranasal
delivery
of
retinal
autoantigen
suppresses
effectively
experimental
autoimmune
uveoretinitis
(
EAU
)
.

To
further
unravel
underlying
mechanisms
the
authors
wished
to
determine
,
firstly
,
the
kinetics
of
antigen
delivery
and
,
secondly
,
the
early
cellular
responses
involved
in
the
initial
stages
of
nasal
mucosal
tolerance
induction
.

METHODS
:
Flow
cytometry
,
cell
proliferation
assays
,
and
microscopy
were
used
to
track
antigen
following
a
single
,
intranasal
dose
of
Alexa-488
labelled
retinal
antigen
.

RESULTS
:
A
rapid
accumulation
of
antigen
within
both
superficial
cervical
lymph
nodes
(
SCLN
)
and
spleen
was
observed
after
30
minutes
.

Significant
proliferative
responses
to
IRBP
were
elicited
by
48
hours
indicating
that
systemic
priming
of
naive
T
cells
to
retinal
antigen
had
occurred
.

Cell
activation
was
further
confirmed
by
immunoprecipitation
studies
,
which
demonstrated
phosphorylation
of
STAT4
but
not
STAT6
in
both
lymph
nodes
and
spleen
.

However
,
at
24
hours
,
STAT4
heterodimerisation
with
STAT
3
was
only
observed
in
spleen
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
results
provide
novel
evidence
that
following
a
single
intranasal
application
rapid
transfer
of
antigen
occurs
.

Resulting
T
cell
proliferation
develops
consequent
to
differential
cell
signalling
in
SCLN
and
spleen
.

Further
understanding
of
these
underlying
cellular
mechanisms
,
in
particular
as
is
inferred
by
the
results
the
contribution
of
local
versus
systemic
tolerance
induction
,
may
assist
in
strategies
to
clinically
apply
mucosal
tolerance
therapy
successfully

Regulation
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
-18
receptor
alpha
chain
expression
on
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
during
T
helper
(
Th
)
1/Th2
differentiation
.

Critical
downregulatory
role
of
IL-4
.

Interleukin
(
IL
)
-18
has
been
well
characterized
as
a
costimulatory
factor
for
the
induction
of
IL-12-mediated
interferon
(
IFN
)
-gamma
production
by
T
helper
(
Th
)
1
cells
,
but
also
can
induce
IL-4
production
and
thus
facilitate
the
differentiation
of
Th2
cells
.

To
determine
the
mechanisms
by
which
IL-18
might
regulate
these
diametrically
distinct
immune
responses
,
we
have
analyzed
the
role
of
cytokines
in
the
regulation
of
IL-18
receptor
alpha
chain
(
IL-18Ralpha
)
expression
.

The
majority
of
peripheral
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
constitutively
expressed
the
IL-18Ralpha
.

Upon
antigen
stimulation
in
the
presence
of
IL-12
,
marked
enhancement
of
IL-18Ralpha
expression
was
observed
.

IL-12
-mediated
upregulation
of
IL-18Ralpha
required
IFN-gamma
.

Activated
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
that
expressed
low
levels
of
IL-18Ralpha
could
produce
IFN-gamma
when
stimulated
with
the
combination
of
IL-12
and
IL-18
,
while
CD4
(
+
)
cells
which
expressed
high
levels
of
IL-18Ralpha
could
respond
to
IL-18
alone
.

In
contrast
,
T
cell
stimulation
in
the
presence
of
IL-4
resulted
in
a
downregulation
of
IL-18Ralpha
expression
.

Both
IL-4
(
-/
)
-
and
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
(
Stat
)
6
(
-/
)
-
T
cells
expressed
higher
levels
of
IL-18Ralpha
after
TCR
stimulation
.

Furthermore
,
activated
T
cells
from
Stat6
(
-/
)
-
mice
produced
more
IFN-gamma
in
response
to
IL-18
than
wild-type
controls
.

Thus
,
positive/negative
regulation
of
the
IL-18Ralpha
by
the
major
inductive
cytokines
(
IL-12
and
IL-4
)
determines
the
capacity
of
IL-18
to
polarize
an
immune
response
.

Glucocorticoid-regulated
transcription
factors
.

Glucocorticoids
are
the
most
effective
antiinflammatory
drugs
used
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
.

They
act
by
binding
to
a
specific
receptor
(
GR
)
that
,
upon
activation
,
translocates
to
the
nucleus
and
either
increases
(
transactivates
)
or
decreases
(
transrepresses
)
gene
expression
.

Inhibition
of
pro-inflammatory
transcription
factors
such
as
activator
protein
(
AP
)
-1
,
signal
transducers
and
activators
of
transcription
(
STATs
)
,
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
and
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappa
B
is
thought
to
be
a
major
action
of
glucocorticoids
.

Acetylation
of
histones
allows
unwinding
of
the
local
DNA
structure
and
enables
RNA
polymerase
II
to
enhance
gene
transcription
.

Histone
acetylation
is
regulated
by
a
balance
between
the
activity
of
histone
acetyltransferases
(
HATs
)
and
histone
deacetylases
(
HDACs
)
.

GR
acts
as
a
direct
inhibitor
of
NF-kappa
B-induced
HAT
activity
and
also
by
recruiting
HDAC2
to
the
NF-kappa
B/HAT
complex
.

A
sub-group
of
patients
with
glucocorticoid-insensitive
asthma
have
an
inability
to
induce
histone
acetylation
in
response
to
dexamethasone
suggesting
reduced
expression
of
a
GR-specific
HAT
.

This
suggests
that
pharmacological
manipulation
of
specific
histone
acetylation
status
is
a
potentially
useful
approach
for
the
treatment
of
inflammatory
diseases
.

Identification
of
the
precise
mechanism
by
which
activated
GR
recruits
HDAC2
may
reveal
new
targets
for
the
development
of
drugs
that
may
dissociate
the
antiinflammatory
actions
of
glucocorticoids
from
their
side
effects
that
are
largely
due
to
gene
induction
.

Differential
ultraviolet-B-induced
immunomodulation
in
XPA
,
XPC
,
and
CSB
DNA
repair-deficient
mice
.

Ultraviolet
B
irradiation
has
serious
consequences
for
cellular
immunity
and
can
suppress
the
rejection
of
skin
tumors
and
the
resistance
to
infectious
diseases
.

DNA
damage
plays
a
crucial
role
in
these
immunomodulatory
effects
of
ultraviolet
B
,
as
impaired
repair
of
ultraviolet-B-induced
DNA
damage
has
been
shown
to
cause
suppression
of
cellular
immunity
.

Ultraviolet-B-induced
DNA
damage
is
repaired
by
the
nucleotide
excision
repair
mechanism
very
efficiently
.

Nucleotide
excision
repair
comprises
two
subpathways
:
transcription-coupled
and
global
genome
repair
.

In
this
study
the
immunologic
consequences
of
specific
nucleotide
excision
repair
defects
in
three
mouse
models
,
XPA
,
XPC
,
and
CSB
mutant
mice
,
were
investigated
.

XPA
mice
carry
a
total
nucleotide
excision
repair
defect
,
whereas
XPC
and
CSB
mice
only
lack
global
genome
and
transcription-coupled
nucleotide
excision
repair
,
respectively
.

Our
data
demonstrate
that
cellular
immune
parameters
in
XPA
,
XPC
,
and
CSB
mice
are
normal
compared
with
their
wild-type
(
control
)
littermates
.

This
may
indicate
that
the
reported
altered
cellular
responses
in
xeroderma
pigmentosum
patients
are
not
constitutive
but
could
be
due
to
external
factors
,
such
as
ultraviolet
B
.

Upon
exposure
to
ultraviolet
B
,
only
XPA
mice
are
very
sensitive
to
ultraviolet-B-induced
inhibition
of
Th1-mediated
contact
hypersensitivity
responses
and
interferon-gamma
production
in
skin
draining
lymph
nodes
.

Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
and
interleukin-10
production
are
significantly
augmented
in
both
XPA
and
CSB
mice
after
ultraviolet
B
exposure
.

Lymph
node
cell
numbers
were
increased
very
significantly
in
XPA
,
mildly
increased
in
CSB
,
and
not
in
XPC
mice
.

In
general
XPC
mice
do
not
exhibit
any
indication
of
enhanced
ultraviolet
B
susceptibility
with
regard
to
the
immune
parameters
analyzed
.

These
data
suggest
that
both
global
genome
repair
and
transcription-coupled
repair
are
needed
to
prevent
immunomodulation
by
ultraviolet
B
,
whereas
transcription-coupled
repair
is
the
major
DNA
repair
subpathway
of
nucleotide
excision
repair
that
prevents
the
acute
ultraviolet-B-induced
effects
such
as
erythema
.

Biomechanical
strain
induces
class
a
scavenger
receptor
expression
in
human
monocyte/macrophages
and
THP-1
cells
:
a
potential
mechanism
of
increased
atherosclerosis
in
hypertension
.

BACKGROUND
:
Although
hypertension
is
an
important
risk
factor
for
the
development
of
atherosclerosis
,
the
mechanisms
for
this
interaction
are
incompletely
described
.

Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
biomechanical
strain
regulates
macrophage
phenotype
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
biomechanical
strain
can
induce
expression
of
the
class
A
scavenger
receptor
(
SRA
)
,
an
important
lipoprotein
receptor
in
atherogenesis
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
Human
monocyte/macrophages
or
THP-1
cells
were
cultured
in
a
device
that
imposes
uniform
biaxial
cyclic
1-Hz
strains
of
0
%
,
1
%
,
2
%
,
or
3
%
,
and
SRA
expression
was
analyzed
.

Mechanical
strains
induced
SRA
mRNA
(
3.5+/-0.6-fold
at
3
%
strain
for
48
hours
,
P
<
0.01
)
and
SRA
protein
in
THP-1
cells
in
an
amplitude-dependent
manner
.

This
induction
was
accompanied
by
augmented
expression
of
the
class
B
scavenger
receptor
CD36
(
2.8+/-0.3-fold
,
P
<
0.001
)
but
not
by
increased
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma
expression
.

To
evaluate
this
effect
in
vivo
,
apolipoprotein
E
(
-/-
)
mice
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
standard
chow
,
a
high-cholesterol
diet
,
or
a
high-cholesterol
diet
with
hypertension
induced
by
angiotensin
II
infusion
for
8
weeks
.

Immunohistochemistry
revealed
that
among
macrophages
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
of
the
aorta
,
the
proportion
of
macrophages
with
SRA
expression
was
highest
in
hypertensive
animals
on
a
high-cholesterol
diet
(
43.9+/-0.7
%
,
versus
12.0+/-2.0
%
for
normotensive
animals
on
a
high-cholesterol
diet
and
4.7+/-4.7
%
for
animals
on
standard
chow
;
P
<
0.001
)
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Biomechanical
strain
induces
SRA
expression
by
monocyte/macrophages
,
suggesting
a
novel
mechanism
for
promotion
of
atherosclerosis
in
hypertensive
patients
.

High
glucose
induces
MCP-1
expression
partly
via
tyrosine
kinase-AP-1
pathway
in
peritoneal
mesothelial
cells
.

BACKGROUND
:
High
glucose
in
peritoneal
dialysis
solutions
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
peritoneal
fibrosis
in
chronic
ambulatory
peritoneal
dialysis
(
CAPD
)
patients
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
are
not
very
clear
.

Peritoneal
macrophages
seem
to
participate
in
the
process
of
peritoneal
fibrosis
and
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
(
MCP-1
)
plays
a
key
role
in
the
recruitment
of
monocytes
toward
the
peritoneal
cavity
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
effect
of
high
glucose
on
MCP-1
expression
and
its
signal
transduction
pathway
in
human
peritoneal
mesothelial
cells
.

METHODS
:
Mesothelial
cells
were
cultured
with
glucose
(
5
to
100
mmol/L
)
or
mannitol
chronically
for
up
to
seven
days
.

MCP-1
expression
of
mRNA
and
protein
was
measured
by
Northern
blot
analysis
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
.

Chemotactic
activity
of
high-glucose-conditioned
culture
supernatant
was
measured
by
chemotactic
assay
.

To
examine
the
roles
of
the
transcription
factors
activator
protein-1
(
AP-1
)
and
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
,
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
(
EMSA
)
was
performed
.

RESULTS
:
Glucose
induced
MCP-1
mRNA
expression
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
.

MCP-1
protein
in
cell
culture
supernant
was
also
increased
.

Equivalent
concentrations
of
mannitol
had
no
significant
effect
.

High-glucose-conditioned
supernatant
possessed
an
increased
chemotactic
activity
for
monocytes
,
which
was
neutralized
by
anti-MCP-1
antibody
.

EMSA
revealed
that
glucose
increased
the
AP-1
binding
activity
in
a
time-
and
dose-dependent
manner
,
but
not
NF-kappaB
.

Curcumin
,
an
inhibitor
of
AP-1
,
dose-dependently
suppressed
the
induction
of
MCP-1
mRNA
by
high
glucose
.

Tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
such
as
genistein
(
12.5
to
50
micromol/L
)
and
herbimycin
A
(
0.1
to
1
micromol/L
)
inhibited
the
high-glucose-induced
MCP-1
mRNA
expression
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
,
and
also
suppressed
the
high-glucose-induced
AP-1
binding
activity
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
:
High
glucose
induced
mesothelial
MCP-1
expression
partly
via
the
tyrosine
kinase-
AP-1
pathway
.

Signal
thresholds
and
modular
synergy
during
expression
of
costimulatory
molecules
in
B
lymphocytes
.

We
analyzed
intracellular
pathways
modulating
surface
densities
of
CD80
and
CD86
in
B
cells
activated
through
ligation
of
the
Ag
receptor
,
and
the
adhesion
molecule
CD54
.

Whereas
B
cell
Ag
receptor
(
BCR
)
cross-linking
alone
stimulated
increased
expression
of
CD86
,
up-regulation
of
CD80
required
dual
stimulation
with
anti-IgM
and
anti-CD54
.

The
principal
downstream
component
contributed
by
BCR
signaling
,
toward
both
CD80
and
CD86
induction
,
was
the
elevated
concentration
of
free
cytoplasmic
Ca
(
2+
)
,
recruited
by
way
of
capacitative
influx
.

This
alone
was
sufficient
to
generate
an
increase
in
CD86
levels
.

However
,
CD80
enhancement
required
the
concerted
action
of
both
intracellular
Ca
(
2+
)
concentration
and
CD54-initiated
pathways
.

The
nexus
between
anti-IgM
and
anti-CD54
stimulation
,
in
the
context
of
CD80
regulation
,
was
identified
to
involve
a
self-propagating
process
of
sequential
synergy
.

The
first
step
involved
amplified
accumulation
of
intracellular
cAMP
,
as
a
result
of
cross-talk
between
BCR
-mobilized
Ca
(
2+
)
and
CD54-derived
signals
.

This
then
facilitated
a
second
synergistic
interaction
between
Ca
(
2+
)
and
cAMP
,
culminating
in
CD80
expression
.

Our
findings
of
distinct
signal
transducer
requirements
,
with
the
added
consequences
of
cross-talk
,
offers
an
explanation
for
variable
modulation
of
costimulatory
molecule
expression
in
response
to
diverse
physiological
stimuli
.

Importantly
,
these
results
also
reveal
how
concentration
threshold
barriers
for
recruitment
of
individual
second
messengers
can
be
overcome
by
constructive
convergence
of
signaling
modules
.

The
role
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
in
neoplastic
transformation
.

In
this
review
,
we
focus
on
new
data
from
basic
,
translational
and
clinical
research
relating
to
the
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
.

Beside
its
well-known
tropism
for
B
lymphocytes
and
epithelial
cells
,
EBV
also
infects
T
lymphocytes
,
monocytes
and
granulocytes
.

After
primary
infection
,
EBV
persists
throughout
the
life
span
in
resting
memory
B
cells
,
from
where
it
is
reactivated
upon
breakdown
of
cellular
immunity
.

In
the
process
of
neoplastic
transformation
,
the
EBV-encoded
latent
membrane
protein
1
(
LMP1
)
oncogene
represents
the
major
driving
force
.

LMP1
acts
like
a
constitutively
activated
receptor
of
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
receptor
family
and
allows
the
amplification
or
bypassing
of
physiological
regulatory
signals
through
direct
and
indirect
interactions
with
proteins
of
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
receptor-associated
factor
(
TRAF
)
family
.

TRAF2
-mediated
NF-kappaB
activation
,
AP-1
induction
and
JAK3
/
STAT
activation
may
result
in
sustained
proliferation
leading
to
lymphoma
.

The
ability
of
LMP1
to
suppress
germinal
center
formation
and
its
capacity
to
mediate
its
own
transcriptional
activation
shed
new
light
on
the
pathogenesis
of
EBV-associated
latency
type
II
lymphoproliferations
like
Hodgkin
's
disease
and
angioimmunoblastic
lymphadenopathy
.

The
carboxy
terminus
of
LMP1
is
also
a
reliable
marker
for
individual
EBV
strain
identification
and
thus
offers
new
possibilities
in
tracing
the
molecular
events
leading
to
posttransplant
lymphoproliferative
disorders
(
PTLDs
)
.

Cytotoxic
T
lymphocytes
directed
against
well-characterized
epitopes
of
EBV
latency
genes
represent
an
already
successful
and
promising
therapeutic
approach
to
EBV-associated
lymphomas
,
in
particular
PTLDs

Interferon-alpha
drives
T
cell-mediated
immunopathology
in
the
intestine
.

The
ability
of
interferon
(
IFN
)
-alpha
to
induce
autoimmunity
and
exacerbate
Th1
diseases
is
well
known
.

We
have
recently
described
enhanced
expression
of
IFN-alpha
in
the
mucosa
of
patients
with
celiac
disease
(
CD
)
,
a
gluten-sensitive
Th1-mediated
enteropathy
,
characterized
by
villous
atrophy
and
crypt
cell
hyperplasia
.

Previous
studies
from
this
laboratory
have
shown
that
T
cell
activation
in
explant
cultures
of
human
fetal
gut
can
also
result
in
villous
atrophy
and
crypt
cell
hyperplasia
.

We
have
,
therefore
,
examined
changes
that
take
place
in
explant
cultures
of
human
fetal
gut
after
activation
of
T
cells
with
anti-CD3
and/or
IFN-alpha
.

We
show
that
activation
of
T
cells
with
anti-CD3
alone
elicits
a
small
IFN-gamma
and
TNF-alpha
response
with
no
tissue
injury
.

Similarly
,
no
changes
are
seen
in
explants
cultured
with
IFN-alpha
alone
.

However
,
addition
of
IFN-alpha
with
anti-CD3
results
in
enhanced
Th1
response
and
crypt
cell
hyperplasia
.

This
is
associated
with
enhanced
phosphorylation
of
STAT1
,
STAT3
,
and
Fyn
,
a
Src
homology
tyrosine
kinase
,
which
interacts
with
both
TCR
and
IFN-alpha
signal
components
.

Together
these
data
indicate
that
IFN-alpha
can
facilitate
activation
of
Th1-reactive
cells
in
the
gut
and
drive
immunopathology
.

Suppression
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
production
by
cAMP
in
human
monocytes
:
dissociation
with
mRNA
level
and
independent
of
interleukin-10
.

BACKGROUND
:
Elevation
of
cellular
cAMP
inhibits
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-stimulated
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
production
and
increases
the
expression
of
interleukin
(
IL
)
-10
in
mononuclear
cells
.

TNF-alpha
gene
expression
obligates
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor
kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
.

Exogenous
IL-10
inhibits
NF-kappaB
in
monocytes
and
thus
attenuates
TNF-alpha
production
.

We
examined
the
role
of
endogenous
IL-10
in
the
regulation
of
NF-kappaB
activation
and
TNF-alpha
production
in
human
monocytes
by
cAMP
.

METHODS
:
Human
monocytes
were
stimulated
with
Escherichia
coli
LPS
(
100
ng/ml
)
with
and
without
forskolin
(
FSK
,
50
microM
)
or
dibutyryl
cyclic
AMP
(
dbcAMP
,
100
microM
)
.

Cytokine
(
TNF-alpha
and
IL-10
)
release
was
measured
by
immunoassay
.

TNF-alpha
mRNA
was
measured
by
reverse
transcription
polymerase
chain
reaction
,
and
NF-kappaB
DNA
binding
activity
was
assessed
by
gel
mobility
shift
assay
.

RESULTS
:
cAMP-elevating
agents
inhibited
LPS-stimulated
TNF-alpha
release
(
0.77
+/-
0.13
ng/10
(
6
)
cells
in
LPS
+
dbcAMP
and
0.68
+/-
0.19
ng/10
(
6
)
cells
in
LPS
+
FSK
,
both
P
<
0.05
vs
1.61
+/-
0.34
ng/10
(
6
)
cells
in
LPS
alone
)
.

Conversely
,
cAMP
enhanced
LPS-stimulated
IL-10
release
(
100
+/-
21.5
pg/10
(
6
)
cells
in
LPS
+
dbcAMP
and
110
+/-
25.2
pg/10
(
6
)
cells
in
LPS
+
FSK
,
both
P
<
0.05
vs
53.3
+/-
12.8
pg/10
(
6
)
cells
in
LPS
alone
)
.

Neither
TNF-alpha
mRNA
expression
nor
NF-kappaB
activation
stimulated
by
LPS
was
inhibited
by
the
cAMP-elevating
agents
.

Neutralization
of
IL-10
with
a
specific
antibody
did
not
attenuate
the
effect
of
cAMP-elevating
agents
on
TNF-alpha
production
.

CONCLUSION
:
The
results
indicate
that
cAMP
inhibits
LPS-stimulated
TNF-alpha
production
through
a
posttranscriptional
mechanism
that
is
independent
of
endogenous
IL-10
.

Activation
of
the
p21
(
CIP1/WAF1
)
promoter
by
bone
morphogenetic
protein-2
in
mouse
B
lineage
cells
.

BMPs
exert
a
negative
growth
effect
on
various
types
of
cells
.

We
have
previously
reported
that
BMP-2
inhibited
the
growth
of
HS-72
mouse
hybridoma
cells
by
inducing
p21
(
CIP1/WAF1
)
expression
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
demonstrated
that
BMP-2
activated
the
mouse
p21
(
CIP1/WAF1
)
promoter
in
HS-72
cells
,
and
that
a
29-base
pair
(
b
)
region
of
the
promoter
(
-1928/-1900
relative
to
the
TATA
box
)
,
conserved
between
mice
and
humans
,
was
responsive
to
BMP-2
as
well
as
expression
of
Smad1
,
Smad4
,
and
constitutively
active
mutants
of
BMP
type
I
receptors
.

Furthermore
,
an
oligonucleotide
containing
the
29-b
region
was
found
to
be
associated
with
Smad4
and
phosphorylated
Smad1
in
the
nuclear
extract
of
BMP-2
-stimulated
HS-72
cells
.

These
results
suggested
that
BMP-2
might
activate
p21
(
CIP1/WAF1
)
transcription
by
inducing
a
binding
of
Smad4
and
Smad1
to
the
29-b
region
in
HS-72
cells
.

Dendritic
cell
development
from
common
myeloid
progenitors
.

Dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
are
professional
antigen-presenting
cells
which
both
initiate
adaptive
immune
responses
and
control
tolerance
to
self-antigens
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
these
different
effects
on
responder
cells
depend
on
subsets
of
DCs
arising
from
either
myeloid
or
lymphoid
hematopoietic
origins
.

In
this
model
,
CD8
alpha+
Mac-1-
DCs
are
supposed
to
be
of
lymphoid
while
CD8
alpha-
Mac-1+
DCs
are
supposed
to
be
of
myeloid
origin
.

Here
we
summarize
our
findings
that
both
CD8
alpha+
and
CD8
alpha-
DCs
can
arise
from
clonogenic
common
myeloid
progenitors
(
CMPs
)
in
both
thymus
and
spleen
.

Therefore
CD8
alpha
expression
DCs
does
not
indicate
a
lymphoid
origin
and
differences
among
CD8
alpha+
and
CD8
alpha-
DCs
might
rather
reflect
maturation
status
than
ontogeny
.

On
the
basis
of
transplantation
studies
,
it
seems
likely
that
most
of
the
DCs
in
secondary
lymphoid
organs
and
a
substantial
fraction
of
thymic
DCs
are
myeloid-derived
.

Macrophage
stimulation
with
Murabutide
,
an
HIV-suppressive
muramyl
peptide
derivative
,
selectively
activates
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinases
1
and
2
,
C/EBPbeta
and
STAT1
:
role
of
CD14
and
Toll-like
receptors
2
and
4
.

The
smallest
unit
of
bacterial
peptidoglycans
known
to
be
endowed
with
biological
activities
is
muramyl
dipeptide
(
MDP
)
.

A
clinically
acceptable
synthetic
derivative
of
MDP
,
namely
murabutide
(
MB
)
,
has
been
found
to
present
interesting
pharmacological
properties
and
to
suppress
HIV-1
replication
in
monocyte-derived
macrophages
(
MDM
)
.

We
have
addressed
the
signaling
events
activated
in
MDM
following
stimulation
with
either
MB
or
the
potent
immunostimulant
LPS
.

We
also
examined
whether
signaling
by
muramyl
peptides
involves
the
use
of
cell
surface
receptors
,
including
CD14
and
Toll-like
receptor
2
(
TLR2
)
or
TLR4
that
are
known
to
be
signal-transducing
receptors
for
other
bacterial
cell
wall
components
.

We
demonstrate
that
,
unlike
LPS
,
the
safe
immunomodulator
MB
selectively
activates
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinases
(
Erk
)
1/2
,
in
the
absence
of
detectable
Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
or
p38
mitogen-activated
kinase
activation
.

Furthermore
,
STAT1
activation
but
weak
or
no
activation
of
STAT3
or
STAT5
respectively
,
could
be
detected
in
MB-stimulated
MDM
.

Using
MonoMac6
cells
,
we
observed
high
C/EBPbeta
and
AP-1
but
weaker
and
transient
NF-kappaB
activation
by
MB
.

Moreover
,
the
truncated
form
of
C/EBPbeta
,
known
to
repress
HIV-1
transcription
,
was
detected
in
extracts
from
MB-treated
THP-1
cells
.

Surprisingly
,
neither
MB
nor
MDP
were
able
to
transduce
signals
via
CD14
and
TLR2
or
4
.

These
findings
present
major
differences
in
the
early
cell
activation
process
between
LPS
and
muramyl
peptides
,
and
strongly
argue
for
the
implication
of
co-receptors
other
than
TLR2
and
TLR4
in
mediating
the
signaling
events
induced
by
defined
subunits
of
bacterial
peptidoglycans
.

Nuclear
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptors
alpha
and
gamma
have
opposing
effects
on
monocyte
chemotaxis
in
endometriosis
.

The
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptors
(
PPARs
)
alpha
and
gamma
are
nuclear
receptors
that
play
important
roles
in
inflammatory
diseases
like
ulcerative
colitis
and
arthritis
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
the
possible
role
of
PPARs
in
macrophage
attraction
into
the
peritoneal
cavity
of
patients
with
endometriosis
.

We
identified
PPAR-alpha
and
-gamma
messenger
RNA
by
RT-PCR
and
protein
by
immunoblotting
of
lysates
of
peritoneal
macrophages
and
monocytic
U937
cells
.

Using
immunocytochemistry
,
we
localized
PPAR-alpha
and
-gamma
within
the
nuclei
of
both
cell
types
.

Monocyte
chemotactic
activity
of
peritoneal
fluid
from
patients
with
endometriosis
was
quantified
in
Boyden
chambers
.

Migration
of
U937
cells
was
increased
by
WY
14643
and
reduced
by
rosiglitazone
.

Peritoneal
fluid
from
patients
with
endometriosis
activated
U937
cells
transiently
transfected
with
a
PPAR-alpha/GAL4
luciferase
reporter
.

By
contrast
,
peritoneal
fluid
did
not
cause
significant
activation
of
PPAR-gamma/GAL4
constructs
.

The
U937
cells
transiently
transfected
with
a
PPAR
response
element
luciferase
reporter
showed
disease
stage-dependent
up-regulation
when
treated
with
peritoneal
fluid
from
patients
with
endometriosis
.

Treatment
with
peritoneal
fluid
from
healthy
controls
down-regulated
PPAR
response
element
transactivation
.

We
conclude
that
peritoneal
fluid
of
endometriosis
patients
contains
activators
of
PPAR-alpha
that
stimulate
macrophage
chemotaxis
.

Inhibitors
of
PPAR-alpha
or
activators
of
PPAR-gamma
could
be
developed
for
the
treatment
of
inflammation
associated
with
endometriosis
.

Long-term-impaired
expression
of
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
and
I
kappa
B
alpha
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
of
trauma
patients
.

Nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappa
B
expression
and
dimer
characteristics
were
studied
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
of
major-trauma
patients
and
healthy
controls
.

Analysis
of
PBMCs
on
days
1
,
3
,
5
,
and
10
after
trauma
revealed
that
expression
of
both
p65p50
heterodimers
and
p50p50
homodimers
was
significantly
reduced
compared
with
that
in
controls
.

In
vitro
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
stimulation
of
PBMCs
induced
NF-kappa
B
translocation
.

However
,
throughout
the
survey
,
p65p50
activation
remained
significantly
lower
in
trauma
patients
than
in
controls
.

After
LPS
stimulation
in
vitro
,
the
p65p50/p50p50
ratio
was
significantly
lower
in
PBMCs
from
trauma
patients
than
from
healthy
controls
.

The
ex
vivo
expression
of
I
kappa
B
alpha
was
higher
in
PBMCs
of
controls
than
of
trauma
patients
.

LPS
did
not
induce
I
kappa
B
expression
in
PBMCs
from
trauma
patients
,
but
strong
induction
was
obtained
with
staphylococci
,
suggesting
that
this
defect
is
not
universal
and
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
activating
signal
.

Although
no
direct
correlation
was
found
between
levels
of
interleukin-10
or
transforming

factor-beta
and
NF-kappa
B
,
these
immunosuppressive
cytokines
were
significantly
elevated
in

patients
by
10
days
after
admission
.

The
long-term

Hepatic
ischemia-reperfusion
injury
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
morbidity
associated
with
liver
transplantation
and
major
hepatic
resections
is
partly
a
result
of
ischemia-reperfusion
injury
.

DATA
SOURCES
:
The
entire
world
literature
on
the
subject
was
searched
via
Medline
.

Keywords
included
reperfusion
injury
,
transplantation
,
liver
resection
,
nitric
oxide
,
endothelin
,
cytokines
,
Kupffer
cells
,
ischemic/ischaemic
preconditioning
,
and
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
An
imbalance
between
endothelin
and
nitric
oxide
levels
results
in
failure
of
the
hepatic
microcirculation
at
the
onset
of
reperfusion
.

Activation
of
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
in
the
liver
promotes
proinflammatory
cytokine
and
adhesion
molecule
synthesis
.

These
result
in
oxygen-derived
free
radical
production
and
neutrophil
recruitment
,
further
contributing
to
cellular
injury
.

Various
therapeutic
modalities
acting
on
the
above
mediators
have
been
successfully
used
to
attenuate
reperfusion
injury
in
animal
models
of
hepatic
transplantation
and
resection
.

Application
of
the
knowledge
gained
from
animal
models
of
hepatic
ischemia-reperfusion
to
the
clinical
setting
will
improve
the
outcome
of
hepatic

Down-regulation
of
IL-12
p40
gene
in
Plasmodium
berghei-infected
mice
.

We
analyzed
the
mechanism
that
causes
suppression
of
IL-12
p40
gene
induction
during
Plasmodium
berghei
infection
.

Although
IL-12
together
with
IFN-gamma
plays
an
important
role
in
protection
against
pathogenic
infection
,
the
IL-12
p70
protein
production
of
infected
macrophages
is
lower
than
that
by
the
uninfected
macrophages
.

We
showed
in
the
present
study
that
the
induction
of
IL-12
p40
gene
but
not
IL-12
p35
gene
in
macrophages
of
P.
berghei-infected
mice
was
profoundly
inhibited
.

The
inhibition
was
induced
by
interaction
with
macrophages
that
had
contacted
with
P.
berghei-infected
erythrocytes
and
was
mediated
by
a
soluble
factor
,
IL-10
.

There
was
comparable
activation
of
NF-kappaB
in
uninfected
and
infected
cells
.

The
induction
of
IFN-regulatory
factor-1
gene
was
comparable
in
transcription
level
in
uninfected
and
infected
cells
,
while
the
unidentified
complex
formation
of
IFN-regulatory
factor-1
was
observed
in
infected
cells
.

Therefore
,
the
inhibition
of
the
IL-12
p40
gene
induction
appeared
to
be
regulated
at
transcriptional
regulation
level
of
the
gene
.

Friend
of

transcription
.

During
vertebrate
hematopoiesis
,
FOG
and
GATA
proteins
cooperate
to
promote
erythrocyte
and
megakaryocyte
differentiation
.

The
Drosophila
FOG
homologue
U-shaped
(
Ush
)
is
expressed
similarly
in
the
blood
cell
anlage
during
embryogenesis
.

During
hematopoiesis
,
the
acute
myeloid
leukemia

homologue
Lozenge
and
Glial
cells
missing
are
required
for
the
production
of
crystal
cells
and
plasmatocytes
,
respectively
.

However
,
additional
factors
have
been
predicted
to
control
crystal
cell
proliferation
.

In
this
report
,
we
show
that
Ush
is
expressed
in
hemocyte
precursors
and
plasmatocytes
throughout
embryogenesis
and
larval
development
,
and
the
GATA
factor
Serpent
is
essential
for
Ush
embryonic
expression
.

Furthermore
,
loss
of
ush
function
results
in
an
overproduction
of
crystal
cells
,
whereas
forced
expression
of
Ush
reduces
this
cell
population
.

Murine
FOG-1
and
FOG-2
also
can
repress
crystal
cell
production
,
but
a
mutant
version
of
FOG-2
lacking
a
conserved
motif
that
binds
the
corepressor
C-terminal
binding
protein
fails
to
affect
the
cell
lineage
.

The
GATA
factor
Pannier
(
Pnr
)
is
required
for
eye
and
heart
development
in
Drosophila
.

When
Ush
,
FOG-1
,
FOG-2
,
or
mutant
FOG-2
is
coexpressed
with
Pnr
during
these
developmental
processes
,
severe
eye
and
heart
phenotypes
result
,
consistent
with
a
conserved
negative
regulation
of
Pnr
function
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
fly
and
mouse
FOG
proteins
function
similarly
in
three
distinct
cellular
contexts
in
Drosophila
,
but

The
RING
finger
protein
Siah-1
regulates
the
level
of
the
transcriptional
coactivator
OBF-1
.

The
transcriptional
coactivator
OBF-1
,
which
interacts
with
Oct-1
and
Oct-2
and
the
octamer
site
DNA
,
has
been
shown
to
be
critical
for
development
of
a
normal
immune
response
and
the
formation
of
germinal
centers
in
secondary
lymphoid
organs
.

Here
we
have
identified
the
RING
finger
protein
Siah-1
as
a
protein
interacting
specifically
with
OBF-1
.

This
interaction
is
mediated
by
the
C-terminal
part
of
Siah-1
and
by
residues
in
the
N-terminus
of
OBF-1
,
partly
distinct
from
the
residues
required
for
formation
of
a
complex
with
the
Oct
POU
domains
and
the
DNA
.

Interaction
between
Siah-1
and
OBF-1
leads
to
downregulation
of
OBF-1
protein
level
but
not
mRNA
,
and
to
a
corresponding
reduction
in
octamer
site-dependent
transcription
activation
.

Inhibition
of
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway
in
B
cells
leads
to
elevated
levels
of
OBF-1
protein
.

Furthermore
,
in
immunized
mice
,
OBF-1
protein
amounts
are
dramatically
increased
in
primary
activated
B
cells
,
without
concomitant
increase
in
OBF-1
mRNA
.

These
data
suggest
that
Siah-1
is
part
of
a
novel
regulatory
loop
controlling
the
level
of
OBF-1
protein
in
B
cells
.

The

The

(

)
with
their
coactivator
beta-catenin
mediates

to

.

We
show
here
that
T
cell
maturation
depends
on
the
presence
of
the
beta-catenin
--
binding
domain
in
TCF-1
.

This
domain
is
necessary
to
mediate
the
survival
of

CD8
(

double-positive
(

Accelerated
spontaneous

of

correlates
with

low
expression
of
the

Bcl-x

Increasing

effectors
in
thymocytes
by
the
use
of

Thus
,
TCF-1
,
upon
association
with
beta-catenin
,
transiently
ensures
the
survival
of
immature
T
cells
,
which
enables
them
to

TRAIL/Apo2L

Multiple

remains
incurable
and
novel
treatments
are
urgently

Preclinical
in

were

of
human

-related
apoptosis-inducing
ligand/Apo2
ligand
(
TRAIL/Apo2L
)
in

.

TRAIL/Apo2L
potently
induced
apoptosis
of
MM
cells
from
patients
and
the

of

,
including

sensitive
or
resistant
to
dexamethasone
(
Dex
)
,
doxorubicin
(
Dox
)
,
melphalan
,
and
mitoxantrone
.

TRAIL/Apo2L
also
overcame
the
survival
effect
of
interleukin

on
MM
cells
and
did
not
affect
the
survival
of
peripheral

and
bone

and
purified
B
cells
from
healthy
donors
.

The

of
the
TRAIL

(
assessed
by
immunoblotting
and
flow

)
could
not
predict
TRAIL
sensitivity
of
MM

.

The
anti-MM
activity
of
TRAIL/Apo2L
was
confirmed
in
nu/xid/bg

xenografted
with

;
TRAIL

enhanced
the

against

reversed
the

were
not

CD28
costimulation
is
required
not
only
to
induce
IL-12
receptor
but
also
to
render
janus
kinases/STAT4
responsive
to
IL-12
stimulation
in
TCR-triggered
T
cells
.

The
activation
of
resting
T
cells
for
the
acquisition
of
various
functions
depends
on
whether
CD28
costimulatory
signals
are
provided
upon
T
cell
receptor
stimulation
.

Here
,
we
investigated
how
CD28
costimulation
functions
to
allow
TCR
-triggered
resting
T
cells
to
acquire
IL-12
responsiveness
.

When
T
cells
are
stimulated
with
low
doses
of
anti-CD3
mAb
,
CD28
costimulation
was
required
for
the
optimal
levels
of
IL-12
receptor
(
IL-12R
)
expression
.

However
,
stimulation
of
T
cells
with
high
doses
of
anti-CD3
alone
induced
comparable
levels
of
IL-12R
expression
to
those
induced
upon
CD28
costimulation
.

Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
substantial
difference
in
IL-12
responsiveness
between
these
two
groups
of
T
cells
:
compared
to
anti-CD28-costimulated
T
cells
,
T
cells
that
were
not
costimulated
with
anti-CD28
exhibited
decreased
levels
of
Janus
kinases
(
JAK
)
JAK2/TYK2
and
STAT4
phosphorylation
and
IFN-y
production
following
IL-12
stimulation
.

Importantly
,
STAT6
phosphorylation
following
IL-4
stimulation
was
not
decreased
in
anti-CD28-uncostimulated
T
cells
.

These
resutls
indicate
that
CD28
costimulation
not
only
contributes
to
up-regulating
IL-12R
expression
but
is
also
required
to
render
JAKs/STAT4
responsive
to
IL-12
stimulation
.

'
inositol

,
phosphatases
that
negatively
regulate
the
phosphatidylinositol

(

)
pathway
,
revealed
an
increased
number
of
macrophages
in
these
animals
,
suggesting
an
essential
role
for
the
PI3K
pathway
for
macro-phage
survival
.

Here
,
we
focused
on
the
role
of
the
PI3K-regulated
serine/threonine
kinase
Akt-1
in
modulating
macrophage
survival
.

Akt-1
was
constitutively
activated
in
human
macrophages
and
addition
of
the
PI3K
inhibitor
,
LY294002
,
suppressed
the
activation
of
Akt-1
and
induced
cell
death
.

Furthermore
,
suppression
of
Akt-1
by
inhibition
of
PI3K
or
a
dominant
negative
(
DN
)
Akt-1
resulted
in
loss
of
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
activation
of
caspases-9
and
-3
,
and
DNA
fragmentation
.

The
effects
of
PI3K
inhibition
were
reversed
by
the
ectopic
expression
of
constitutively
activated
Akt-1
or
Bcl-x
(
L
)
.

Inhibition
of
PI3K
/Akt-1
pathway
either
by
LY294002
or
DN
Akt-1
had
no
effect
on
the
constitutive
or
inducible
activation
of
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappaB
in
human
macrophages
.

However
,
after
inhibition
of
the
PI3K
/
Akt-1
pathway
,
a
marked
decrease
in
the
expression
of
the
antiapoptotic
molecule
Mcl-1
,
but
not
other
Bcl-2
family
members
was
observed
,
and
Mcl-1
rescued
macrophages
from
LY294002-induced
cell
death
.

Further
,
inhibition
of
Mcl-1
by
antisense
oligonucleotides
,
also
resulted
in
macrophage
apoptosis
.

Thus
,
our
findings
demonstrate
that
the
constitutive
activation
of
Akt-1
regulates
macrophage
survival
through
Mcl-1
,
which
is
independent
of

GRbeta
expression
in
nasal
polyp
inflammatory
cells
and
its
relationship
to
the
anti-inflammatory
effects
of
intranasal
fluticasone
.

BACKGROUND
:
Nasal
polyposis
disease
is
an
inflammatory
disorder
with
intense
eosinophilic
infiltration
of
respiratory
mucosa
that
is
often
difficult
to
control
with
topical
steroids
.

Recent
evidence
suggests
that
overexpression
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
splice
variant
GRbeta
in
inflammatory
cells
might
contribute
to
steroid
insensitivity
in
diseases
such
as
asthma
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
purposes
of
this
investigation
were
to
determine
whether
nasal
polyp
(
NP
)
inflammatory
cells
overexpress
GRbeta
and
to
examine
whether
GRbeta
overexpression
is
associated
with
insensitivity
to
the
potent
topical
steroid
fluticasone
propionate
(
FP
)
.

METHODS
:
Biopsies
were
obtained
from
10
subjects
with
NPs
before
and
4
weeks
after
treatment
with
intranasal
FP
.

Middle
turbinates
biopsies
from
6
healthy
,
nonallergic
subjects
served
as
normal
controls
.

Biopsies
were
immunostained
for
inflammatory
cell
markers
as
well
as
GRbeta
and
probed
for
various
cytokine
mRNA
.

The
anti-inflammatory
response
to
FP
was
examined
in
relation
to
pretreatment
levels
of
GRbeta
expression
.

RESULTS
:
The
total
numbers
of
inflammatory
cells
were
increased
in
NPs
.

The
percentage
of
inflammatory
cells
expressing
GRbeta
was
also
increased
(
40.5
%
+/-
19.2
%
vs
16.1
%
+/-
4.0
%
,
P
=.009
)
.

GRbeta
expression
in
NPs
was
almost
exclusive
to
T
lymphocytes
,
eosinophils
,
and
macrophages
.

An
inverse
correlation
was
observed
between
the
baseline
inflammatory
cell
GRbeta
expression
and
the
reduction
after
FP
treatment
in
EG2-positive
eosinophils
,
CD4-positive
T
lymphocytes
,
endothelial
VCAM-1
expression
,
and
IL-4
mRNA-positive
cells
.

NPs
that
were
``
FP-insensitive
''
in
terms
of
suppression
of
eosinophil
numbers
(
major
basic
protein
-positive
)
had
a
significantly
greater
percentage
of
GRbeta-positive
inflammatory
cells
,
a
higher
ratio
of
GRbeta-positive/GRalpha-positive
cells
,
and
increased
numbers
of
GRbeta-positive
eosinophils
and
macrophages
in
comparison
with
those
that
were
``
FP-sensitive.
''

``
FP-insensitive
''
NPs
also
demonstrated
a
higher
percentage
of
IL-5-positive
inflammatory
cells
expressing
GRbeta
before
and
after
FP
treatment
.

CONCLUSION
:
GRbeta
expression
appears
to
be
a
marker
of
steroid
insensitivity
in
NPs
.

Expression
of
GRbeta
by
NP
inflammatory
cells
,
particularly
T
cells
and
eosinophils
,
might
render
them
resistant
to
suppression
by
topical
steroids
and
thereby
contribute
to
persistent
NP
inflammation
.

including
several
that
are
also
found
in
the
minimal
promoters
of
galectins
-1
,
-2
,
and
-3
.

The
decrease
in
gal-10
promoter
activity
after
disruption
of
either
the
GC
box
(
-44
to
-50
)
or
the
Oct
site
(
-255
to
-261
)
suggests
that
these
sites
,
along
with
the
previously
characterized
GATA
and
EoTF
sites
,
are
necessary
for
full
promoter
activity
.

By
supershift
analysis
,
we
demonstrate
binding
of
the
transcription
factors
Sp1
and
Oct1
to
the
consensus
GC
box
and
the
Oct
site
,
respectively
.

Similar
to
gal-1
,
gal-10
expression
is
induced
by
butyric
acid
,
an
effect
that
is
lost
upon
ablation
of
the
GC
box
.

Additionally
,
we
demonstrate
AML3
binding
to
the
consensus
AML
site
and
YY1
binding
to
the
Inr
sequence
,
both
elements
functioning
as
silencers
in
the
gal-10
promoter
.

Role
of
the
stroma
in
mammary
development
.

Mammary
development
depends
on
branching
morphogenesis
,
namely
the
bifurcation
and
extension
of
ductal
growth
points
(
end
buds
)
and
secretory
lobules
into
a
more
or
less
fatty
stroma
.

Because
breast
carcinomas
are
overwhelmingly
ductal
in
origin
,
this
review
focuses
on
stromal
influences
guiding
postnatal
ductal
development
and
there
is
only
the
briefest
account
of
the
role
of
embryonic
stroma
(
mesenchyme
)
.

The
stroma
as
the
necessary
target
for
endocrine
mammogens
and
the
source
of
stimulatory
growth
factors
is
described
and
the
importance
of
mammary
epithelium-induced
modifications
of
the
periductal
stroma
is
emphasized
.

Evidence
is
presented
that
if
they
are
to
grow
,
end
buds
must
condition
proximal
fatty
stroma
by
recruiting
white
blood
cells
as
well
as
inducing
stromal
cell
division
and
,
possibly
,
estrogen
receptors
.

The
induction
of
a
fibrous
stromal
tunic
around
the
end
bud
is
described
and
its
likely
role
as
a
complex
ductal
morphogen
is
discussed
;
a
possible
role
in
growth
inhibition
is
also
considered
.

Although
the
signals
governing
fibrotic
induction
,
ductal
morphogenesis
,
and
growth
inhibition
are
unknown
,
a
role
for
transforming
growth
factor-beta
is
highly
likely
and
is
discussed
.

Finally
,
a
need
for
new
conceptual
and
experimental
approaches
to
understanding
stromal-epithelial
signaling
is
discussed
.

Adipophilin
is
a
sensitive
marker
for
lipid
loading
in
human
blood
monocytes
.

Adipophilin
,
a
marker
of
lipid
accumulation
initially
described
in
adipocytes
,
was
recently
shown
to
be
induced
in
macrophage
foam
cells
.

We
found
that
even
freshly
isolated
blood
monocytes
express
adipophilin
and
that
the
amount
of
adipophilin
protein
is
variable
in
monocytes
from
different
healthy
individuals
.

However
,
the
physiological
expression
of
adipophilin
does
not
correlate
with
the
levels
of
free
fatty
acids
,
cholesterylesters
or
free
cholesterol
.

Enzymatically
modified
low-density
lipoprotein
(
E-LDL
)
induces
rapid
foam
cell
formation
in
monocytes
and
upregulates
adipophilin
mRNA
and
protein
within
2
h
of
incubation
.

This
rapid
induction
of
adipophilin
is
accompanied
by
a
significant
increase
of
free
fatty
acids
in
monocytes
incubated
with
E-LDL
.

Adipophilin
facilitates
the
uptake
of
free
fatty
acids
,
and
here
we
demonstrate
that
free
fatty
acids
increase
is
related
to
the
early
upregulation
of
adipophilin
expression
in
blood
monocytes
.

Fatty
acids
are
ligands
for
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
,
and
the
upregulation
of
adipophilin
mRNA
by
PPARgamma
agonists
like
15d-PGJ
(
2
)
and
ciglitazone
indicates
that
PPARgamma
may
mediate
the
induction
of
adipophilin
expression
in
human
blood
monocytes
.

Constitutive
expression
of
MHC
class
II
genes
in
melanoma
cell
lines
results
from
the
transcription
of
class
II
transactivator
abnormally
initiated
from
its
B
cell-specific
promoter
.

In
melanoma
cell
lines
,
two
different
patterns
of
MHC
class
II
expression
have
been
described
,
either
an
IFN
gamma-inducible
expression
of
HLA-DR
and
HLA-DP
,
with
a
faint
or
null
expression
of
HLA-DQ
,
resembling
that
described
for
melanocytes
,
or
a
constitutive
expression
,
i.e.
,
IFN-gamma
independent
,
of
all
three
HLA-D
isotypes
.

As
this
latter
phenotype
has
been
associated
with
a
more
rapid
progression
of
melanoma
tumors
,
we
have
analyzed
in
different
melanoma
cell
lines
the
molecular
mechanisms
leading
to
this
abnormal
pattern
of
MHC
class
II
expression
.

In
agreement
with
the
evidence
of
a
coordinate
transcription
of
the
HLA-D
genes
in
these
cell
lines
,
we
have
shown
the
constitutive
expression
of
CIITA
(
class
II
transactivator
)
transcripts
,
CIITA
being
known
as
the
master
switch
of
MHC
class
II
expression
.

Unexpectedly
,
these
transcripts
initiate
from
promoter
III
of
the
CIITA
gene
,
a
promoter
that
is
mainly
used
constitutively
in
B
lymphocytes
.

This
expression
was
further
shown
to
occur
through
factor
(
s
)
acting
on
the
enhancer
located
upstream
of
CIITA
promoter
III
,
which
was
previously
described
in
epithelioid
cells
as
an
IFN-gamma-response
sequence
.

The
hypothesis
of
a
general
abnormality
of
the
IFN-gamma
transduction
pathway
was
dismissed
.

Constitutive
transcription
of
CIITA
from
promoter
III
having
been
observed
in
unrelated
melanoma
cell
lines
,
we
propose
the
hypothesis
that
this
phenomenon
might
not
be
a
random
event
,
but
could
be
linked
to
the
neoplasic
state
of
the
melanoma
cells

Caspase
-mediated
calcineurin
activation
contributes
to
IL-2
release
during
T
cell
activation
.

Calcineurin
,
a
Ca
(
2+
)
/calmodulin-dependent
Ser/Thr
phosphatase
(
protein
phosphatase
2B
)
,
plays
a
critical
role
in
IL-2
production
during
T
cell
activation
.

It
has
been
previously
reported
that
IL-2
release
in
activated
Jurkat
T
requires
caspase-like
activity
(
Posmantur
et
al.
(

)
Exp.
Cell.

,

)
.

We
report
here
that
the
60-kDa
catalytic
subunit
of
calcineurin
A
(
Cn
A
)
was
partially
cleaved
to
a
45-kDa
form
in
phytohemagglutinin
A
(
PHA
)
or
phorbol
ester
+
ionomycin
(
P
+
I
)
-activated
Jurkat
cells
.

In
parallel
,
proteolytic
activation
of
upstream
caspases
(
caspase-8
and
-9
)
as
well
as
effector
caspase-3
was
also
observed
.

Cn
A
cleavage
was
caspase
mediated
,
since
it
was
inhibitable
by
pan-caspase
inhibitor
Cbz-Asp-CH
(
2
)
OC
(
O
)
-2
,
6-dichlorobenzene
(
Z-D-DCB
)
.

Cn
A
cleavage
was
also
observed
when
purified
calcineurin
was
digested
in
vitro
with
caspase-3
.

Truncated
Cn
A
was
associated
with
enhanced
phosphatase
activity
and
reduced
calmodulin
sensitivity
.

Furthermore
,
in
PHA
or
P
+
I-activated
Jurkat
cells
,
dephosphorylation
of
calcineurin
substrate
NFATc
(
a
transcription
factor
known
to
be
involved
in
transactivation
of
the
IL-2
gene
)
,
was
also
suppressed
by
Z-D-DCB
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
suggest
that
caspase-mediated
cleavage
of
Cn
A
contributes
to
IL-2
production
during
T
cell
activation
.

Maturation
of
human
dendritic
cells
as
sulfasalazine
target
.

AIM
:
Sulfasalazine
,
a
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
,
is
effective
in
treating
some
autoimmune
diseases
,
but
its
mechanism
of
action
is
unclear
.

To
determine
whether
dendritic
cells
could
be
a
possible
target
of
the
drug
,
we
studied
the
effects
of
sulfasalazine
and
its
metabolites
,
aminosalicylate
and
sulfapyridine
,
on
in
vitro
maturation
(
terminal
differentiation
)
of
human
myeloid
dendritic
cells
.

METHODS
:
We
prepared
immature
dendritic
cells
by
incubating
CD14-positive
cells
in
the
presence
of
granulocyte-
macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
and
interleukin
(
IL
)
-4
.

The
cells
were
matured
by
addition
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
-a
,
IL-1
beta
,
and
prostaglandin
E2
in
the
presence
of
sulfasalazine
or
its
metabolites
--
aminosalicylate
and
sulfapyridine
,
or
their
combinations
.

We
quantified
the
effect
of
drugs
on
the
dendritic
cell
characteristics
,
such
as
stimulation
of
autologous
and
allogeneic
pan-T
cell
proliferation
,
surface
marker
phenotype
,
IL-12
p40
subunit
secretion
,
and
activation
of
nuclear
transcription
factor
(
NF
)
-kappa
B
.

RESULTS
:
Dendritic
cells
treated
with
sulfasalazine
(
1.25
micromol/L
or
2.5
micromol/L
)
could
not
stimulate
T
cells
(
p
<
0.028
,
two-sided
paired
t-test
)
.

In
distinction
to
drug-free
maturing
dendritic
cells
,
2.5
micromol/L
sulfasalazine
upregulated
the
levels
of
CD14
and
CD68
and
downregulated
the
levels
of
CD40
,
CD80
,
and
CD83
(
for
all
CD
markers
,
p
<
0.03
for
difference
between
measurements
in
the
absence
and
the
presence
of
sulfasalazine
)
.

From
concentration-dependent
changes
in
CD83
expression
,
we
found
an
apparent
ID50
>
>
1.5
micromol/L
sulfasalazine
.

The
apparent
ID50
value
for
aminosalicylate-inhibited
maturation
was
4
micromol/L
.

Sulfapyridine
had
no
effect
.

At
1.25
micromol/L
,
sulfasalazine
largely
inhibited
NF-kB
activation
in
dendritic
cells
.

CONCLUSION
:
Maturing
human
dendritic
cells
are
hundred-fold
more
sensitive
to
sulfasalazine
than
T
cells
and
NK
cells
and
the
most
sensitive
human
cells
described
so
far
.

Thus
,
dendritic
cell
maturation
is
an
important
target
of
sulfasalazine
.

Because
of
the
role
of
dendritic
cells
in
(
auto
)
immunity
,
inhibition
of
their
maturation
might
provide
a
target
for
further
optimization
of
sulfasalazine
therapy
.

Defective
function
of
the
proteasome
in
autoimmunity
:
involvement
of
impaired
NF-kappaB
activation
.

Type
1
diabetes
(
also
known
as
insulin-dependent
diabetes
mellitus
or
juvenile-onset
diabetes
)
is
usually
caused
by
T
cell-mediated
autoimmunity
,
with
a
prediabetic
state
characterized
by
the
production
of
autoantibodies
specific
for
proteins
expressed
by
pancreatic
beta
cells
.

The
nonobese
patient
with
diabetes
(
NOD
)
mouse
is
a
spontaneous
model
of
type
1
diabetes
with
a
strong
genetic
component
that
maps
to
the
major
histocompatibility
complex
(
MHC
)
region
of
the
genome
.

A
specific
proteasome
defect
has
been
identified
in
NOD
mouse
in
select
lymphocytic
and
monocytic
lineages
that
results
from
down-regulation
of
expression
of
the
proteasome
subunit
LMP2
,
which
is
encoded
by
a
gene
in
the
MHC
genomic
region
.

This
defect
prevents
the
proteolytic
processing
required
for
the
production
and
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
,
which
plays
important
roles
in
immune
and
inflammatory
responses
,
as
well
as
increases
the
susceptibility
of
the
affected
cells
to
apoptosis
induced
by
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
.

The
novel
role
of
the
proteasome
in
dysfunction
in
autoimmunity
is
presented
and
documented
to
be
both
tissue
and
developmental
stage
specific
.

We
propose
a
role
of
the
proteasome
as
a
step
in
disease
pathogenesis
and
tissue
targeting
.

Down-regulation
of
TDT
transcription
in
CD4
(
+
)
CD8
(
+
)
thymocytes
by
Ikaros
proteins
in
direct
competition
with
an
Ets
activator
.

Ikaros
is
a
unique
regulator
of
lymphopoiesis
that
associates
with
pericentromeric
heterochromatin
and
has
been
implicated
in
heritable
gene
inactivation
.

Binding
and
competition
experiments
demonstrate
that
Ikaros
dimers
compete
with
an
Ets
activator
for
occupancy
of
the
lymphocyte-specific
TdT
promoter
.

Mutations
that
selectively
disrupt
Ikaros
binding
to
an
integrated
TdT
promoter
had
no
effect
on
promoter
function
in
a
CD4
(
+
)
CD8
(
+
)
thymocyte
line
.

However
,
these
mutations
abolished
down-regulation
on
differentiation
,
providing
evidence
that
Ikaros
plays
a
direct
role
in
repression
.

Reduced
access
to
restriction
enzyme
cleavage
suggested
that
chromatin
alterations
accompany
down-regulation
.

The
Ikaros-dependent
down-regulation
event
and
the
observed
chromatin
alterations
appear
to
precede
pericentromeric
repositioning
.

Current
models
propose
that
the
functions
of
Ikaros
should
be
disrupted
by
a
small
isoform
that
retains
the
dimerization
domain
and
lacks
the
DNA-binding
domain
.

Surprisingly
,
in
the
CD4
(
+
)
CD8
(
+
)
thymocyte
line
,
overexpression
of
a
small
Ikaros
isoform
had
no
effect
on
differentiation
or
on
the
pericentromeric
targeting
and
DNA-binding
properties
of
Ikaros
.

Rather
,
the
small
isoform
assembled
into
multimeric
complexes
with
DNA-bound
Ikaros
at
the
pericentromeric
foci
.

The
capacity
for
in
vivo
multimer
formation
suggests
that
interactions
between
Ikaros
dimers
bound
to
the
TdT
promoter
and
those
bound
to
pericentromeric
repeat
sequences
may
contribute
to
the
pericentromeric
repositioning
of
the
inactive
gene
.

Type
I
interferons
and
IL-12
:
convergence
and
cross-regulation
among
mediators
of
cellular
immunity
.

Therapeutic
use
of
type
I
IFN
(
IFN-alpha/beta
)
has
become
common
.

Many
of
the
diverse
diseases
targeted
are
marked
by
pathogenetic
abnormalities
in
cell-mediated
immunity
(
CMI
)
,
these
cellular
immune
responses
either
causing
injury
to
the
host
,
lacking
sufficient
vigor
for
virus
or
tumor
clearance
,
or
both
.

In
general
,
therapeutic
efficacy
is
limited
.

It
is
thus
notable
that
the
pleiotropic
effects
of
type
I
IFN
on
CMI
remain
poorly
understood
.

We
characterized
the
effects
of
type
I
IFN
on
the
production
of
IL-12
,
the
central
immunoregulatory
cytokine
of
the
CD4
(
+
)
T
cell
arm
of
CMI
.

We
show
that
type
I
IFN
are
potent
inhibitors
of
IL-12
production
by
human
monocytes/macrophages
.

The
underlying
mechanism
involves
transcriptional
inhibition
of
the
IL-12p40
gene
,
marked
by
down-regulation
of
PU.1
binding
activity
at
the
upstream
Ets
site
of
the
IL-12p40
promoter
.

Type
I
IFN
have
previously
been
shown
to
be
able
to
substitute
for
IL-12
in
driving
IFN-gamma
production
from
T
and
NK
cells
.

The
ability
of
IFN-alpha/beta
to
suppress
IL-12
production
while
up-regulating
IFN-gamma
production
suggests
a
possible
mechanistic
basis
for
the
difficulties
of
employing
these
cytokines
in
diseases
involving
abnormalities
of
CMI
.

Nuclear
factor-kappaB
suppressive
and
inhibitor-kappaB
stimulatory
effects
of
troglitazone
in
obese
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
:
evidence
of
an
antiinflammatory
action
?

It
has
been
shown
recently
that
troglitazone
exerts
an
anti-inflammatory
effect
,
in
vitro
,
and
in
experimental
animals
.

To
test
these
properties
in
humans
,
we
investigated
the
effect
of
troglitazone
on
the
proinflammatory
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappaB
and
its
inhibitory
protein
IkappaB
in
mononuclear
cells
(
MNC
)
and
plasma
soluble
intracellular
adhesion
molecule-1
,
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
,
plasminogen
activator
inhibitor-1
,
and
C-reactive
protein
.

We
also
examined
the
effect
of
troglitazone
on
reactive
oxygen
species
generation
,
p47
(
phox
)
subunit
expression
,
9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic
acid
(
9-HODE
)
,
13-HODE
,
o-tyrosine
,
and
m-tyrosine
in
obese
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
.

Seven
obese
patients
with
type
2
diabetes
were
treated
with
troglitazone
(
400
mg/day
)
for
4
weeks
.

Blood
samples
were
obtained
at
weekly
intervals
.

Nuclear
factor-kappaB
binding
activity
in
MNC
nuclear
extracts
was
significantly
inhibited
after
troglitazone
treatment
at
week
1
and
continued
to
be
inhibited
up
to
week
4
.

On
the
other
hand
,
IkappaB
protein
levels
increased
significantly
after
troglitazone
treatment
at
week
1
,
and
this
increase
persisted
throughout
the
study
.

Plasma
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
and
soluble
intracellular
adhesion
molecule-1
concentrations
did
not
decrease
significantly
after
troglitazone
treatment
,
although
there
was
a
trend
toward
inhibition
.

13-HODE/linoleic

also
decreased
after
troglitazone
intake
.

However
,
o-tyrosine/phenylalanine
and
m-tyrosine/phenylalanine
ratios
did
not
change
significantly
.

These
data
show
that
troglitazone
has
profound
antiinflammatory
effects
in
addition
to
antioxidant
effects
in
obese
type
2
diabetics
;
these
effects
may
be
relevant
to
the
recently
described
beneficial
antiatherosclerotic
effects
of
troglitazone
at
the
vascular
level
.

OX40
stimulation
by
gp34/OX40
ligand
enhances
productive
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
infection
.

OX40
is
a
member
of
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
receptor
superfamily
and
known
to
be
an
important
costimulatory
molecule
expressed
on
activated
T
cells
.

To
investigate
the
role
of
costimulation
of
OX40
in
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
infection
by
its
natural
ligand
,
gp34
,
the
OX40-transfected
ACH-2
cell
line
,
ACH-2/OX40
,
chronically
infected
with
HIV-1
,
was
cocultured
with
paraformaldehyde
(
PFA
)
-fixed
gp34-transfected
mouse
cell
line
,
SV-T2/gp34
.

The
results
showed
that
HIV-1
production
was
strongly
induced
.

This
was
followed
by
apparent
apoptosis
,
and
both
processes
were
specifically
inhibited
by
the
gp34
-specific
neutralizing
monoclonal
antibody
5A8
.

Endogenous
TNF
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
and
TNF-beta
production
were
not
involved
in
the
enhanced
HIV-1
production
.

Furthermore
,
enhanced
HIV-1
transcription
in
gp34
-stimulated
ACH-2/OX40
cells
was
dependent
on
the
kappa
B
site
of
the
HIV-1
long
terminal
repeat
,
and
the
OX40-gp34
interaction
activated
NF-kappa
B
consisting
of
p50
and
p65
subunits
.

When
primary
activated
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
acutely
infected
with
HIV-1
(
NL4-3
)
(
CXCR4-using
T-cell-line-tropic
)
were
cocultured
with
PFA-fixed
gp34
(
+
)
human
T-cell
leukemia
virus
type
1-bearing
MT-2
cells
or
SV-T2/gp34
cells
,
HIV-1
production
was
also
markedly
enhanced
.

The
enhancement
was
again
significantly
inhibited
by
5A8
.

The
present
study
first
shows
that
OX40-gp34
interaction
stimulates
HIV-1
expression
and
suggests
that
OX40
triggering
by
gp34
may
play
an
important
role
in
enhancing
HIV-1
production
in
both
acutely
and
latently
infected

Troglitazone
,
a
PPARgamma
ligand
,
inhibits
osteopontin
gene
expression
in
human
monocytes/macrophage
THP-1
cells
.

Peroxizome
proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
is
a
member
of
the
nuclear
receptor
family
of
transcription
factors
that
regulate
adipocyte
differentiation
.

Recent
studies
indicate
that
liganded
PPARgamma
not
only
promotes
differentiation
but
also
inhibits
the
activation
of
macrophages
.

Osteopontin
,
a
component
of
extracellular
matrix
,
is
synthesized
by
macrophages
in
atherosclerotic
plaques
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
whether
PPARgamma
ligand
regulates
osteopontin
gene
expression
in
THP-1
cells
,
a
cell
line
derived
from
human
monocytic
leukemia
cells
which
can
differentiate
to
macrophage
upon
stimulation
with
phorbol
ester
PMA
.

Northern
blot
analysis
showed
that
osteopontin
expression
is
markedly
induced
in
response
to
PMA
.

Troglitazone
,
a
PPARgamma
ligand
,
dramatically
attenuated
the
PMA-induced
osteopontin
expression
.

Transient
transfection
assays
of
the
human
osteopontin
promoter/luciferase
construct
which
contains
a
5'-flanking
region
between
-1500
and
+87
relative
to
the
transcription
start
site
demonstrate
that
either
treatment
with
troglitazone
or
cotransfection
of
PPARgamma
expression
vector
inhibits
osteopontin
promoter
activity
.

These
data
indicate
that
troglitazone
reduces
osteopontin
gene
expression
at
transcriptional
level
through
PPARgamma
activation
,
and
suggest
the
role
of
troglitazone
in
inhibiting
the
ability
of
macrophages
to
produce
extracellular
matrix
,
which
is
particularly
relevant
to
atherosclerotic
plaque
formation
.

Transcription
factor
NF-kappa
B
regulates
Ig
lambda
light
chain
gene
rearrangement
.

The
tissue-
and
stage-specific
assembly
of
Ig
and
TCR
genes
is
mediated
by
a
common
V
(
D
)
J
recombinase
complex
in
precursor
lymphocytes
.

Directed
alterations
in
the
accessibility
of
V
,
D
,
and
J
gene
segments
target
the
recombinase
to
specific
Ag
receptor
loci
.

Accessibility
within
a
given
locus
is
regulated
by
the
functional
interaction
of
transcription
factors
with
cognate
enhancer
elements
and
correlates
with
the
transcriptional
activity
of
unrearranged
gene
segments
.

As
demonstrated
in
our
prior
studies
,
rearrangement
of
the
Igkappa
locus
is
regulated
by
the
inducible
transcription
factor
NF-kappaB
.

In
contrast
to
the
Igkappa
locus
,
known
transcriptional
control
elements
in
the
Iglambda
locus
lack
functional
NF-kappaB
binding
sites
.

Consistent
with
this
observation
,
the
expression
of
assembled
Iglambda
genes
in
mature
B
cells
has
been
shown
to
be
NF-kappaB
independent
.

Nonetheless
,
we
now
show
that
specific
repression
of
NF-kappaB
inhibits
germline
transcription
and
recombination
of
Iglambda
gene
segments
in
precursor
B
cells
.

Molecular
analyses
indicate
that
the
block
in
NF-kappaB
impairs
Iglambda
rearrangement
at
the
level
of
recombinase
accessibility
.

In
contrast
,
the
activities
of
known
Iglambda
promoter
and
enhancer
elements
are
unaffected
in
the
same
cellular
background
.

These
findings
expand
the
range
of
NF-kappaB
action
in
precursor
B
cells
beyond
Igkappa
to
include
the
control
of
recombinational
accessibility
at
both
L
chain
loci
.

Moreover
,
our
results
strongly
suggest
the
existence
of
a
novel
Iglambda
regulatory
element
that
is
either
directly
or
indirectly
activated
by
NF-kappaB
during
the
early
stages
of
B
cell
development
.

Transcription
factor
STAT5A
is
a
substrate
of
Bruton
's
tyrosine
kinase
in
B
cells
.

STAT5A
is
a
molecular
regulator
of
proliferation
,
differentiation
,
and
apoptosis
in
lymphohematopoietic
cells
.

Here
we
show
that
STAT5A
can
serve
as
a
functional
substrate
of
Bruton
's
tyrosine
kinase
(
BTK
)
.

Purified
recombinant
BTK
was
capable
of
directly
binding
purified
recombinant
STAT5A
with
high
affinity
(
K
(
d
)
=
44
nm
)
,
as
determined
by
surface
plasmon
resonance
using
a
BIAcore
biosensor
system
.

BTK
was
also
capable
of
tyrosine-phosphorylating
ectopically
expressed
recombinant
STAT5A
on
Tyr
(
694
)
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
in
a
Janus
kinase
3
-independent
fashion
.

BTK
phosphorylated
the
Y665F
,
Y668F
,
and
Y682F
,
Y683F
mutants
but
not
the
Y694F
mutant
of
STAT5A
.

STAT5A
mutations
in
the
Src
homology
2
(
SH2
)
and
SH3
domains
did
not
alter
the
BTK
-mediated
tyrosine
phosphorylation
.

Recombinant
BTK
proteins
with
mutant
pleckstrin
homology
,
SH2
,
or
SH3
domains
were
capable
of
phosphorylating
STAT5A
,
whereas
recombinant
BTK
proteins
with
SH1/kinase
domain
mutations
were
not
.

In
pull-down
experiments
,
only
full-length
BTK
and
its
SH1/kinase
domain
(
but
not
the
pleckstrin
homology
,
SH2
,
or
SH3
domains
)
were
capable
of
binding
STAT5A
.

Ectopically
expressed
BTK
kinase
domain
was
capable
of
tyrosine-phosphorylating
STAT5A
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

BTK
-mediated
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
ectopically
expressed
wild
type
(
but
not
Tyr
(
694
)
mutant
)
STAT5A
enhanced
its
DNA
binding
activity
.

In
BTK
-competent
chicken
B
cells
,
anti-IgM-stimulated
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
STAT5
protein
was
prevented
by
pretreatment
with
the
BTK
inhibitor
LFM-A13
but
not
by
pretreatment
with
the
JAK3
inhibitor
HI-P131
.

B
cell
antigen
receptor
ligation
resulted
in
enhanced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
STAT5
in
BTK
-deficient
chicken
B
cells
reconstituted
with
wild
type
human
BTK
but
not
in
BTK
-deficient
chicken
B
cells
reconstituted
with
kinase-inactive
mutant
BTK
.

Similarly
,
anti-IgM
stimulation
resulted
in
enhanced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
STAT5A
in
BTK
-competent
B
cells
from
wild
type
mice
but
not
in
BTK
-deficient
B
cells
from
XID
mice
.

In
contrast
to
B
cells
from
XID
mice
,
B
cells
from
JAK3
knockout
mice
showed
a
normal
STAT5A
phosphorylation
response
to
anti-IgM
stimulation
.

These
findings
provide
unprecedented
experimental
evidence
that
BTK
plays
a
nonredundant
and
pivotal
role
in
B
cell
antigen
receptor-mediated
STAT5A
activation
in
B
cells

Role
of
T-bet
in
commitment
of
TH1
cells
before
IL-12
-dependent
selection
.

How
cytokines
control
differentiation
of
helper
T
(
TH
)
cells
is
controversial
.

We
show
that
T-bet
,
without
apparent
assistance
from
interleukin
12
(
IL-12
)
/
STAT4
,
specifies
TH1
effector
fate
by
targeting
chromatin
remodeling
to
individual
interferon-gamma
(
IFN-gamma
)
alleles
and
by
inducing
IL-12
receptor
beta2
expression
.

Subsequently
,
it
appears
that
IL-12
/
STAT4
serves
two
essential
functions
in
the
development
of
TH1
cells
:
as
growth
signal
,
inducing
survival
and
cell
division
;
and
as
trans-activator
,
prolonging
IFN-gamma
synthesis
through
a
genetic
interaction
with
the
coactivator
,
CREB-binding
protein
.

These
results
suggest
that
a
cytokine
does
not
simply
induce
TH
fate
choice
but
instead
may
act
as
an
essential
secondary
stimulus
that
mediates
selective
survival
of
a
lineage
.

Stat6
is
necessary
and
sufficient
for
IL-4
's
role
in
Th2
differentiation
and
cell
expansion
.

IL-4
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
differentiation
of
T
CR-stimulated
naive
CD4
T
cells
to
the
Th2
phenotype
.

In
response
to
IL-4
,
the
IL-4R
activates
a
set
of
phosphotyrosine
binding
domain-containing
proteins
,
including
insulin
receptor
substrate
1/2
,
Shc
,
and
IL-4R
interacting
protein
,
as
well
as
Stat6
.

Stat6
has
been
shown
to
be
required
for
Th2
differentiation
.

To
determine
the
roles
of
the
phosphotyrosine
binding
adaptors
in
Th2
differentiation
,
we
prepared
a
retrovirus
containing
a
mutant
of
the
human
(
h
)
IL-4R
alpha-chain
,
Y497F
,
which
is
unable
to
recruit
these
adaptors
.

The
mutant
hIL-4Ralpha
,
as
well
as
the
wild-type
(
WT
)
hIL-4Ralpha
,
was
introduced
into
naive
CD4
T
cells
.

Upon
hIL-4
stimulation
,
Y497F
worked
as
well
as
the
WT
hIL-4Ralpha
in
driving
Th2
differentiation
,
as
measured
by
Gata3
up-regulation
and
IL-4
production
.

Furthermore
,
IL-4-driven
cell
expansion
was
also
normal
in
the
cells
infected
with
Y497F
,
although
cells
infected
with
Y497F
were
not
capable
of
phosphorylating
insulin
receptor
substrate
2
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
signal
pathway
mediated
by
Y497
is
dispensable
for
both
IL-4
-driven
Th2
differentiation
and
cell
expansion
.

Both
WT
and
Y497F
hIL-4Ralpha
lose
the
ability
to
drive
Th2
differentiation
and
cell
expansion
in
Stat6-knockout
CD4
T
cells
.

A
constitutively
activated
form
of
Stat6
introduced
into
CD4
T
cells
resulted
in
both
Th2
differentiation
and
enhanced
cell
expansion
.

Thus
,
activated
Stat6
is
necessary
and
sufficient
to
mediate
both
IL-4
-driven
Th2
differentiation
and
cell
expansion
in
CD4
T
cells
.

The
effect
of
HIV-1
regulatory
proteins
on
cellular
genes
:
derepression
of
the
IL-2
promoter
by
Tat
.

In
HIV-infected
individuals
dysregulation
of
the
immune
system
is
characterized
by
severe
disorders
of
the
cytokine
network
.

Increase
secretion
of
IL-2
,
the
major
T
cell
growth
and
differentiation
cytokine
,
may
play
a
decisive
role
in
sensitization
of
T
cells
for
activation
induced
apoptosis
and
indirect
death
of
activated
T
cells
through
augmented
virus
replication
.

We
investigated
the
cause
of
enhanced
IL-2
secretion
and
found
that
the
HIV
Tat
induces
this
effect
.

We
demonstrate
that
increased
IL-2
secretion
is
due
to
Tat
-enhanced
IL-2
promoter
activation
.

Tat
derepresses
and
activates
the
distal
AP-1
site
(
position
-185
to
-177
)
in
the
IL-2
promoter
.

In
nonstimulated
T
cells
a
repressor
complex
containing
NF-IL6
,
JunB
,
c-Fos
and
Fra-1
is
formed
on
the
AP-1
(
IL-2/d
)
site
and
represses
IL-2
promoter
activity
.

After
T
cell
activation
,
a
heterodimeric
activator
containing
p65
and
c-Jun
binds
to
the
AP-1
(
IL-2/d
)
site
.

HIV
Tat
enhances
activation
of
NF-kappaB
and
consequently
,
activates
the
AP-1
(
IL-2/d
)
site
.

Our
data
provide
evidence
for
a
novel
mechanism
by
which
HIV
Tat
dysregulates
IL-2
production
and
therefore
may
contribute
to
the
HIV-1
infection
in
a
way
yet
to
be
clarified
.

Transforming
growth
factor-beta1
interferes
with
thrombopoietin-induced
signal
transduction
in
megakaryoblastic
and
erythroleukemic
cells
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Thrombopoietin
(
TPO
)
and
transforming
growth
factor-beta
(
1
)
(
TGF-beta
(
1
)
)
have
been
shown
to
exert
opposite
effects
on
proliferation
and
megakaryocytic
differentiation
of
hematopoietic
cells
.

To
determine
whether
TGF-beta
(
1
)
interferes
directly
with
TPO
-induced
signal
transduction
in
hematopoietic
cells
,
we
compared
the
regulatory
effects
in
the
TPO
-responsive
cell
lines
Mo-7e
and
HEL
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
The
cells
were
stimulated
by
100
ng/mL
TPO
and/or
100
ng/mL
TGF-beta1
and
analyzed
for
proliferation
(
3H
thymidine
incorporation
)
,
viability
(
trypan
blue
exclusion
)
,
and
protein
expression
and
phosphorylation
(
Western
blot
)
.

RESULTS
:
TPO
enhanced
the
proliferation
of
Mo-7e
cells
as
determined
by
3H-thymidine
incorporation
,
whereas
TGF-beta1
suppressed
baseline
cell
growth
and
antagonized
the
proliferative
effect
of
TPO
.

TPO
-induced
proliferation
also
was
reduced
by
a
specific
inhibitor
of
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
pathway
(
PD098059
)
,
which
inhibits
activation
of
the
MAPK
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinases
(
ERK
)
ERK1
and
ERK2
,
and
AG490
,
an
inhibitor
of
Janus
kinase-2
,
which
completely
blocked
TPO
-induced
proliferation
.

As
demonstrated
by
Western
blotting
,
TGF-beta1
reduced
the
TPO
-stimulated
ERK1
/
ERK2
and
STAT5
phosphorylation
in
Mo-7e
and
HEL
cells
.

This
effect
was
completely
reversed
by
preincubation
with
a
tyrosine
phosphatase
inhibitor
(
Na3VO4
)
,
which
suggests
that
TGF-beta1
activated
a
phosphatase
.

Although
STAT3
also
was
activated
by
TPO
,
STAT3
activation
remained
unaltered
by
TGF-beta1
.

CONCLUSION
:
Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
that
TGF-beta1
modulates
TPO
-mediated
effects
on
megakaryocytic
proliferation
by
interfering
with
TPO
-induced
signal
transduction
,
particularly
by
reducing
the
activities
of
MAPK
ERK1/ERK2
and
STAT5
.

Invariant
chain
induces
B
cell
maturation
by
activating
a
TAF
(
II
)
105-NF-kappaB
-dependent
transcription
program
.

Early
stages
of
B
cell
development
occur
in
the
bone
marrow
,
resulting
in
formation
of
immature
B
cells
.

From
there
these
immature
cells
migrate
to
the
spleen
where
they
differentiate
to
mature
cells
.

This
final
maturation
step
is
crucial
for
the
B
cells
to
become
responsive
to
antigens
and
to
participate
in
the
immune
response
.

Recently
,
invariant
chain
(
Ii
)
,
a
major
histocompatibility
complex
class
II
chaperone
,
as
well
as
the
transcription
factors
c-Rel
and
p65/RelA
,
were
found
to
play
a
role
in
the
final
antigen-independent
differentiation
stage
of
B
cells
in
the
spleen
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
a
possible
link
between
Ii
-dependent
B
cell
maturation
and
the
NF-kappaB
pathway
.

Our
studies
indicate
that
Ii
-induced
B
cell
maturation
involves
activation
of
transcription
mediated
by
the
NF-kappaB
p65/RelA
homodimer
and
requires
the
B
cell-enriched
coactivator
TBP-associated

.

Apoptotic
processes
,
or
the
disturbance
of
the
natural
regulation
of
these
processes
,
may
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
autoimmune
diseases
(
AID
)
.

Women
are
,
in
general
,
more
susceptible
than
men
to
develop
AID
like
rheumatoid
arthritis
.

Androgens
and
glucocorticoids
,
in
contrast
to
oestrogens
,
have
favourable
effects
in
AID
models
as
well
as
in
human
AID
.

It
is
known
that
glucocorticoids
(
GC
)
,
used
for
treatment
of
AID
,
increase
apoptosis
in
the
thymus
resulting
in
decreased
numbers
of
CD4+
CD8+
thymocytes
.

It
was
asked
whether
androgens
,
in
contrast
to
oestrogens
,
exert
their
favourable
effects
in
the
treatment
of
AID
by
a
mechanism
comparable
to
that
described
for
GC
by
eliminating
the
apoptosis
prone
CD4+
CD8+
population
in
the
thymus
.

Although
both
androgens
and
oestrogens
proved
thymolytic
,
a
significantly
decreased
percentage
of
CD4+
CD8+
thymocytes
was
observed
by
flow
cytometry
after
treatment
of
mice
with
the
androgen
methyltestosterone
,
but
not
with
the
oestrogen
ethinylestradiol
.

To
investigate
whether
the
observed
thymolytic
effects
were
due
to
the
presence
of
hormone
receptors
on
thymocytes
,
cells
were
isolated
from
the
thymus
and
incubated
with
androgens
or
oestrogens
to
measure
apoptosis
.

Several
techniques
were
used
to
determine
thymocyte
apoptosis
in
vitro
,
but
no
enhanced
apoptotic
signal
was
observed
.

Using
the
very
sensitive
TUNEL
assay
,
no
direct
effect
of
androgens
on
thymocytes
in
vitro
could
be
observed
.

This
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
high
signal
observed
with
GC
.

Therefore
,
upon
in
vivo
androgen
treatment
,
other
cells
containing
androgen
receptors
than
thymocytes
are
probably
involved
in
inducing
the
increase
in
thymic
apoptosis
.

To
study
the
role
of
the
androgen
receptor
on
thymocyte
apoptosis
,
androgen
receptor
mutant
(
Tfm/Y
)
mice
were
treated
with
androgens
.

No
alterations
of
thymocyte
subpopulations
were
seen
,
suggesting
that
changes
in
the
percentage
of
CD4+
CD8+
thymocytes
after
administration
of
androgens
depend
on
the
presence
of
functional
androgen
receptors
.

Thus
,
it
is
concluded
that
androgens
indirectly
accelerate
thymocyte
apoptosis
in
vivo
.

Inhibition
of
the
transcription
factors
AP-1
and
NF-kappaB
in
CD4
T
cells
by
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
ligands
.

The
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARgamma
)
,
a
member
of
the
nuclear
hormone
receptor
superfamily
,
is
essential
for
adipocyte
differentiation
and
glucose
homeostasis
.

PPARgamma
has
been
found
recently
to
regulate
macrophage
activation
in
response
to
mitogens
and
inflammation
.

Our
study
shows
PPARgamma
to
be
preferentially
expressed
in
the
nuclei
of
resting
T
cells
and
to
increase
upon
activation
of
T
cells
by
either
anti-CD3
and
anti-CD28
or
phorbol
myristyl
acetate
(
PMA
)
.

We
also
found
the
PPARgamma
ligand
ciglitizone
to
attenuate
the
activation
of
T
cells
by
inhibiting
cytokine
gene
expression
and
anti-CD3
and
anti-CD28
or
PMA-induced
proliferative
responses
.

Inhibition
of
both
the
proliferative
response
and
inflammatory
cytokine
expression
in
CD4
T
cells
was
correlated
with
suppression
of
the
activated
transcription
factors
AP1
and
NF-kappaB
.

PPARgamma
ligands
also
strongly
inhibited
SEA-induced
Vbeta3
T
cell
activation
in
vivo
.

These
results
,
together
with
previous
findings
of
the
inhibitory
effect
of
PPARgamma
ligands
on
activated
macrophages
,
provide
clear
evidence
for
PPARgamma
as
a
negative
regulator
of
the
inflammatory
activation
of
both
macrophage
and
T
cells
.

PPARgamma
may
thus
be
a
potential
therapeutic
target
for
the
treatment
of
autoimmunity
.

A
prominent
role
for
activator
protein-1
in
the
transcription
of
the
human
2B4
(
CD244
)
gene
in
NK
cells
.

The
cell
surface
glycoprotein
2B4
(
CD244
)
of
the
Ig
superfamily
is
involved
in
the
regulation
of
NK
and
T
lymphocyte
functions
.

We
have
recently
identified
CD48
as
the
high
affinity
counterreceptor
for
2B4
in
both
mice
and
humans
.

The
cytoplasmic
domain
of
2B4
associates
with
src
homology
2
domain-containing
protein
or
signaling
lymphocyte
activation
molecule-associated
protein
,
whose
mutation
is
the
underlying
genetic
defect
in
the
X-linked
lymphoproliferative
syndrome
.

In
this
study
,
we
report
the
molecular
cloning
and
characterization
of
the
human
2B4
(
h2B4
)
promoter
.

Through
primer
extension
analysis
,
we
found
that
the
transcription
of
the
h2B4
gene
initiates
at
multiple
start
sites
.

We
isolated
h2B4
genomic
clones
and
PCR
amplified
the
5
'
untranslated
region
containing
the
promoter
elements
.

We
have
identified
a
functional
AP-1
site
that
lies
between
(
-106
to
-100
)
through
transient
transfection
analysis
in
YT
cells
,
a
human
NK
cell
line
.

EMSAs
with
Abs
specific
for
various
protein
factors
of
the
AP-1
family
revealed
that
multiple
members
of
the
Jun
family
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
h2B4
gene
.

Mutation
of
the
AP-1
site
not
only
abolishes
protein/DNA
interactions
but
also
promoter
activity
.

These
results
demonstrate
a
significant
role
for
AP-1
in
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
the
h2B4
gene
.

Functional
correction
of
FA-C
cells
with
FANCC
suppresses
the
expression
of
interferon
gamma-inducible
genes
.

Because
hematopoietic
cells
derived
from
Fanconi
anemia
(
FA
)
patients
of
the
C-complementation
group
(
FA-C
)
are
hypersensitive
to
the
inhibitory
effects
of
interferon
gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
,
the
products
of
certain
IFNgamma-inducible
genes
known
to
influence
hematopoietic
cell
survival
were
quantified
.

High
constitutive
expression
of
the
IFNgamma-inducible
genes
,
IFN-stimulated
gene
factor
3
gamma
subunit
(
ISGF3gamma
)
,
IFN
regulatory
factor-1
(
IRF-1
)
,
and
the
cyclin-dependent
kinase
inhibitor
p21
(
WAF1
)
was
found
in
FANCC
mutant
B
lymphoblasts
,
low-density
bone
marrow
cells
,
and
murine
embryonic
fibroblasts
.

Paradoxically
,
these
cells
do
not
activate
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
(
STAT
)
1
properly
.

In
an
attempt
to
clarify
mechanisms
by
which
FA-C
cells
overexpress
IFNgamma-inducible
genes
in
the
face
of
defective
STAT1
phosphorylation
,
it
was
reasoned
that
decreased
levels
of
activated
STAT1
might
result
in
reduced
expression
of
a
hematopoietic
IFNgamma-responsive
protein
that
normally
modulates
expression
of
other
IFNgamma-responsive
genes
.

Levels
of
the
IFNgamma
-inducible
factor
IFN
consensus
sequence
binding
protein
(
ICSBP
)
,
a
negative
trans-acting
regulator
of
some
IFNgamma-inducible
genes
,
were
quantified
.

ICSBP
levels
were
reduced
in
FA-C
B
lymphoblasts
and
MEFs
.

However
,
enforced
expression
of
ICSBP
failed
to
down-regulate
IRF-1
,
ISGF3gamma
,
and
p21
(
WAF1
)
.

Thus
,
the
FANCC
protein
functions
to
modulate
expression
of
a
family
of
genes
that
in
normal
cells
are
inducible
only
by
specific
environmental
cues
for
apoptosis
or
mitogenic
inhibition
,
but
it
does
so
independently
of
the
classic
IFN-STAT1
pathway
and
is
not
the
direct
result
of
reduced
ICSBP
expression
.

A
genetic
investigation
of
E2A
function
in
lymphocyte
development
.

Lymphocytes
are
derived
from
hematopoietic
stem
cells
(
HSC
)
following
a
series
of
regulated
differentiation
events
.

Multipotent
HSCs
become
committed
to
the
B
cell
lineage
in
bone
marrow
and
the
T
cell
lineage
in
the
thymus
after
receiving
appropriate
signals
from
the
corresponding
microenvironment
.

These
committed
lymphoid
cells
must
then
undergo
V
(
D
)
J
recombination
at
the
immunoglobulin
gene
or
T
cell
receptor
gene
locus
resulting
in
clonal
production
of
functional
B
or
T
lymphocytes
,
respectively
.

Lymphocyte
commitment
and
differentiation
are
accompanied
by
programmed
gene
expression
or
repression
events
which
are
driven
by
lineage
and
stage
specific
transcription
factors
.

The
basic-helix-loop-helix
(
bHLH
)
transcription
factors
encoded
by
the
E2A
gene
are
involved
in
several
differentiation
events
during
B
and
T
cell
development
,
including
lineage
commitment
,
initiation
of
V
(
D
)
J
recombination
,
and
antigen
receptor
mediated
proliferation
and
differentiation
.

Several
recent
reviews
have
provided
a
comprehensive
discussion
of
biochemical
,
cellular
,
and
genetic
research
on
E2A
function
in
lymphocyte
development
(
1
,
2
)
.

Here
,
we
only
discuss
some
of
the
genetic
approaches
our
laboratory
(
except
where
it
is
noted
)
has
undertaken
to
investigate
the
molecular
pathways
mediated
by
E2A
transcription
factors
in
lymphocyte
development

D609
inhibits
ionizing
radiation-induced
oxidative
damage
by
acting
as
a
potent
antioxidant
.

Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate
(
D609
)
has
been
extensively
studied
in
biological
systems
and
exhibits
a
variety
of
biological
functions
,
including
antiviral
,
antitumor
,
and
anti-inflammatory
activities
.

Most
of
these
activities
have
been
largely
attributed
to
the
inhibitory
effect
of
D609
on
phosphatidylcholine-specific
phospholipase
C
.

However
,
as
a
xanthate
derivative
,
D609
is
a
strong
electrolyte
and
readily
dissociates
to
xanthate
anions
and
cations
of
alkali
metals
in
solution
.

Xanthate
anions
and
protonated
xanthic
acid
contain
a
free
thiol
moiety
and
are
highly
reductive
.

This
implies
that
D609
and
other
xanthate
derivatives
may
function
as
potent
antioxidants
.

Indeed
,
we
found
that
D609
inhibited
the
Fenton
reaction-induced
oxidation
of
dihydrorhodamine
123
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
similar
to
that
of
pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate
,
a
well
known
antioxidant
.

In
addition
,
D609
inhibited
the
formation
of
the
alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone-free
radical
spin
adducts
and
lipid
peroxidation
of
synaptosomal
membranes
by
the
Fenton
reagents
.

Furthermore
,
preincubation
of
lymphocytes
with
D609
resulted
in
a
significant
diminution
of
ionizing
radiation
(
IR
)
-induced
1
)
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
;
2
)
decrease
in
intracellular
reduced
glutathione
;
3
)
oxidative
damage
to
proteins
and
lipids
;
and
4
)
activation
of
nuclear
factor-kappaB
.

Moreover
,
when
D609
(
50
mg/kg
i.v.
)
was
administered
to
mice
10
min
prior
to
total
body
IR
(
6.5
and
8.5
Gy
)
,
it
protected
the
mice
from
IR-induced
lethality
.

Thus
,
these
results
indicate
that
D609
is
a
potent
antioxidant
and
has
the
ability
to
inhibit
IR-induced
cellular
oxidative
stress
.

Inhibition
of
AP-1
by
the
glucocorticoid-inducible
protein
GILZ
.

The
immunosuppressive
effects
of
glucocorticoids
arise
largely
by
inhibition
of
cytokine
gene
expression
,
which
has
been
ascribed
to
interference
between
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
and
transcription
factors
such
as
AP-1
and
NF-kappa
B
as
well
as
by
competition
for
common
coactivators
.

Here
we
show
that
glucocorticoid-induced
inhibition
of
interleukin-2
mRNA
expression
in
activated
normal
T
cells
required
new
protein
synthesis
,
suggesting
that
this
phenomenon
is
secondary
to
expression
of
glucocorticoid-regulated
genes
.

One
of
the
most
prominent
glucocorticoid-induced
genes
is
glucocorticoid-induced
leucine
zipper
(
GILZ
)
,
which
has
been
reported
to
inhibit
activation-induced
up-regulation
of
Fas
ligand
(
FasL
)
mRNA
.

Indeed
,
transient
expression
of
GILZ
in
Jurkat
T
cells
blocked
induction
of
a
reporter
construct
driven
by
the
FasL
promoter
.

This
could
be
accounted
for
by
GILZ
-mediated
inhibition
of
Egr-2
and
Egr-3
,
NFAT/AP-1
-inducible
transcription
factors
that
bind
a
regulatory
element
in
the
FasL
promoter
and
up-regulate
FasL
expression
.

GILZ
also
potently
inhibited
AP-1-driven
and
IL-2
promoter-driven
reporter
constructs
,
and
recombinant
GILZ
specifically
interacted
with
c-Fos
and
c-Jun
in
vitro
and
inhibited
the
binding
of
active
AP-1
to
its
target
DNA
.

Whereas
homodimerization
of
GILZ
required
the
presence
of
its
leucine
zipper
,
the
interaction
with
c-Fos
and
c-Jun
occurred
through
the
N-terminal
60-amino
acid
region
of
GILZ
.

Thus
,
GILZ
represents
a
glucocorticoid-induced
gene
product
that
can
inhibit
a
variety
of
activation-induced
events
,
at
least
in
part
by
direct
interference
with
AP-1
,
and
is
therefore
a
candidate
for
a
mediator
of
glucocorticoid-induced
immunosuppression
.

Pharmacokinetic
differences
between
a
T
cell-tolerizing
and
a
T
cell-activating
peptide
.

Vaccination
with
a
peptide
representing
a
CTL
epitope
from
the
human
papillomavirus
(
HPV
)
16
E7
protein
induces
a
specific
CTL
response
that
prevents
the
outgrowth
of
HPV16
E7-expressing
tumors
.

In
contrast
,
vaccination
with
a
peptide
encoding
an
adenovirus
type
5
(
Ad5
)
E1A
CTL
epitope
results
in
CTL
tolerance
and
enhanced
growth
of
an
Ad5
E1A-expressing
tumor
.

It
is
unclear
why
these
peptides
induce
such
opposite
effects
.

To
determine
whether
a
difference
in
pharmacokinetics
can
explain
the
functional
contrasts
,
tritiated
Ad5
E1A
and
HPV16
E7
peptides
were
injected
into
mice
.

Results
show
that
the
tolerizing
peptide
spread
through
the
body
16
times
faster
than
the
activating
peptide
and
was
cleared
at
least
2
times
faster
.

The
HPV16
E7
peptide
kinetics
correlated
with
the
kinetics
of
HPV16
E7
-specific
CTL
induction
.

In
contrast
,
Ad5
E1A
peptide
injection
resulted
in
physical
deletion
of
preexisting
Ad5
E1A
-specific
CTLs
within
24
h
after
injection
.

This
tolerization
occurred
at
the
time
when
the
peptide
reached
its
maximum
peptide
concentration
in
the
organs
.

These
data
suggest
that
ubiquitous
expression
of
the
tolerizing
Ad5
E1A
peptide
within
a
short
period
of
time
causes
activation-induced
cell
death
of
Ad5
E1A
-specific
CTLs
.

Therefore
,
information
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
peptides
is
vital
for
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
peptide-based
vaccines
.

Smad3
and
Smad4
mediate
transforming
growth
factor-beta1
-induced
IgA
expression
in
murine
B
lymphocytes
.

Transforming
growth
factor
(
TGF
)
-beta1
is
well
established
as
a
critical
IgA
isotype
switching
factor
and
Smad
molecules
have
been
reported
to
act
as
transducers
and
transcriptional
factors
in
the
expression
of
TGF-beta1
-targeted
genes
.

We
examined
the
involvement
of
Smad
proteins
in
TGF-beta1
-induced
IgA
expression
.

First
,
we
found
that
TGF-beta1
significantly
increases
endogenous
germ-line
(
GL
)
alpha
transcripts
by
LPS-stimulated
CH12.LX.4933
(
mu
(
+
)
)
B
lymphoma
cells
.

To
investigate
its
signaling
mechanisms
,
the
lymphoma
cell
line
was
transfected
with
pFL3
that
contains
the
TGF-beta-responsive
element
of
the
GLalpha
promoter
,
and
stimulated
with
TGF-beta1
.

Similar
to
endogenous
GLalpha
transcripts
,
TGF-beta1
induces
GLalpha
promoter
activity
and
overexpression
of
Smad3
markedly
enhances
the
promoter
activity
.

This
activity
is
further
augmented
by
cotransfected
Smad4
.

On
the
other
hand
,
Smad7
substantially
abrogates
the
synergistic
effect
of
Smad3/4
on
GLalpha
promoter
activity
.

In
addition
,
overexpression
of
Smad3/4
enhances
TGF-beta1
-induced
endogenous
GLalpha
transcripts
in
normal
spleen
B
cell
s
.

Finally
,
in
the
presence
of
TGF-beta1
,
overexpression
of
Smad3/4
selectively
increases
both
surface
IgA
expression
and
IgA
production
.

The
results
from
the
present
study
indicate
that
Smad3
,
Smad4
,
and
Smad7
,
at
least
in
part
,
serve
as
mediators
linking
TGF-beta1
to
transcriptional
regulation
of
IgA
switching
related
gene
and
regulation
of
IgA
class
switching
.

The
translesion
DNA
polymerase
zeta
plays
a
major
role
in
Ig
and
bcl-6
somatic

.

Ig
somatic
mutations
would
be
introduced
by
a
polymerase
(
pol
)
while
repairing
DNA
outside
main
DNA
replication
.

We
show
that
human
B
cells
constitutively
express
the
translesion
pol
zeta
,
which
effectively
extends
DNA
past
mismatched
bases
(
mispair

,
and

which
bypasses

Upon

these

Thus
,

plays
a

in

perhaps
facilitated
by
the

Molecular
mechanism
of
cell
cycle
progression
induced
by
the
oncogene
product
Tax
of
human
T-cell
leukemia
virus
type
I
.

The
trans-activator
protein
Tax
of
human
T-cell
leukemia
virus
type
I
(
HTLV-I
)
plays
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
adult
T-cell
leukemia
through
,
at
least
in
part
,
its
ability
to
stimulate
cell
growth
.

We
previously
reported
that
Tax
induced
cell
cycle
progression
from
G0/G1
phase
to
S
and
G2/M
phases
in
human
T-cell
line
Kit
225
cells
.

To
elucidate
molecular
mechanism
of
Tax
-induced
cell
cycle
progression
,
we
systematically
examined
the
effects
of
Tax
on
biochemical
events
associated
with
cell
cycle
progression
.

Introduction
of
Tax
into
resting
Kit
225
cells
induced
activation
of
the
G1/S
transition
regulation
cascade
consisting
of
activation
of
cyclin
dependent
kinase
2
(
CDK2
)
and
CDK4
,
phosphorylation
of
the
Rb
family
proteins
and
an
increase
in
free
E2F
.

The
kinase
activation
was
found
to
result
from
Tax
-induced
expression
of
genes
for
cell
cycle
regulatory
molecules
including
cyclin
D2
,
cyclin
E
,
E2F1
,
CDK2
,
CDK4
and
CDK6
,
and
Tax
-induced
reduction
of
CDK
inhibitors
p19
(
INK4d
)
and
p27
(
Kip1
)
.

These
modulations
by
Tax
always
paralleled
the
ability
of
Tax
to
activate
the
NF-kappaB
transcription
pathway
.

These
results
indicate
the
important
role
of
Tax
-mediated
trans-activation
of
the
genes
for
cell
cycle
regulatory
molecules
in
Tax
-induced
cell
cycle
progression
.

Cot
kinase
induces
cyclooxygenase-2
expression
in
T
cells
through
activation
of
the
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
.

Cyclooxygenase-2
(
COX-2
)
is
induced
in
human
T
lymphocytes
upon
T
cell
receptor
triggering
.

Here
we
report
that
Cot
kinase
,
a
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
kinase
kinase
involved
in
T
cell
activation
,
up-regulates
COX-2
gene
expression
in
Jurkat
T
cells
.

Induction
of
COX-2
promoter
activity
by
Cot
kinase
occurred
mainly
through
activation
of
the
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
.

Mutation
of
the
distal
(
-105/-97
)
and
proximal
(
-76/-61
)
NFAT
response
elements
in
the
COX-2
promoter
abolished
the
activation
induced
by
Cot
kinase
.

Even
more
,
coexpression
of
a
dominant
negative
version
of
NFAT
inhibited
Cot
kinase
-mediated
COX-2
promoter
activation
,
whereas
cotransfection
of
a
constitutively
active
version
of
the
calcium-dependent
phosphatase
calcineurin
synergizes
with
Cot
kinase
in
the
up-regulation
of
COX-2
promoter
-driven
transcription
.

Strikingly
,
Cot
kinase
increased
transactivation
mediated
by
a
GAL4-NFAT
fusion
protein
containing
the
N-terminal
transactivation
domain
of
NFATp
.

In
contrast
to
phorbol
ester
plus
calcium
ionophore
A23187
,
Cot
kinase
increases
both
COX-2
promoter
activity
and
NFAT
-mediated
transactivation
in
a
cyclosporin
A-independent
manner
.

These
data
indicate
that
Cot
kinase
up-regulates
COX-2
promoter
-driven
transcription
through
the
NFAT
response
elements
,
being
the
Cot
kinase
-induced
NFAT
-dependent
transactivation
presumably
implicated
in
this
up-regulation
.

Positive
and
negative
roles
of
the
trans-acting
T
cell
factor-1
for
the
acquisition
of
distinct
Ly-49
MHC
class
I
receptors
by
NK
cells
.

Members
of
the
Ly-49
gene
family
code
for
class
I
MHC-specific
receptors
that
regulate
NK
cell
function
.

Due
to
a
combinatorial
distribution
of
Ly-49
receptors
,
NK
cells
display
considerable
clonal
heterogeneity
.

The
acquisition
of
one
Ly-49
receptor
,
Ly-49A
is
strictly
dependent
on
the
transcriptional
trans-acting
factor
T
cell-specific
factor-1
(
TCF-1
)
.

Indeed
,
TCF-1
binds
to
two
sites
in
the
Ly-49a
promoter
and
regulates
its
activity
,
suggesting
that
the
Ly-49a
gene
is
a
direct
TCF-1
target
.

TCF-1
deficiency
resulted
in
the
altered
usage
of
additional
Ly-49
receptors
.

We
show
in
this
study
,
using
TCF-1
beta
(
2
)
-microglobulin
double-deficient
mice
,
that
these
repertoire
alterations
are
not
due
to
Ly-49/MHC
class
I
interactions
.

Our
findings
rather
suggest
a
TCF-1
-dependent
,
cell
autonomous
effect
on
the
acquisition
of
multiple
Ly-49
receptors
.

Besides
reduced
receptor
usage
(
Ly-49A
and
D
)
,
we
also
observed
no
effect
(
Ly-49C
)
and
significantly
expanded
(
Ly-49G
and
I
)
receptor
usage
in
the
absence
of
TCF-1
.

These
effects
did
not
in
all
cases
correlate
with
the
presence
of
TCF
binding
sites
in
the
respective
proximal
promoter
.

Therefore
,
besides
TCF-1
binding
to
the
proximal
promoter
,
Ly-49
acquisition
may
also
be
regulated
by
TCF-1
binding
to
more
distant
cis-acting
elements
and/or
by
regulating
the
expression
of
additional
trans-acting
factors
.

Consistent
with
the
observed
differential
,
positive
or
negative
role
of
TCF-1
for
Ly-49
receptor
acquisition
,
reporter
gene
assays
revealed
the
presence
of
an
inducing
as
well
as
a
repressing
TCF
site
in
certain
proximal
Ly-49
promoters
.

These
findings
reveal
an
important
role
of
TCF-1
for
the
formation
of
the
NK
cell
receptor
repertoire
.

Ligation
of
CD11b
and
CD11c
beta
(
2
)
integrins
by
antibodies
or
soluble
CD23
induces
macrophage
inflammatory
protein
1alpha
(
MIP-1alpha
)
and
MIP-1beta
production
in
primary
human
monocytes
through
a
pathway
dependent
on
nuclear
factor-kappaB
.

Chemokines
and
adhesion
molecules
such
as
integrins
play
a
major
part
in
the
trafficking
,
extravasation
,
and
recruitment
of
leukocytes
to
inflammatory
sites
.

This
study
investigated
the
effects
of
beta
(
2
)
integrin
engagement
on
chemokine
production
by
freshly
isolated
human
monocytes
.

We
found
that
ligation
of
CD11b
or
CD11c
but
not
CD11a
alpha
chains
of
beta
(
2
)
integrins
by
antibodies
or
soluble
CD23
(
sCD23
)
fusion
proteins
rapidly
induced
transcription
and
secretion
of
interleukin
8
,
macrophage
inflammatory
protein
(
MIP
)
1alpha
,
and
MIP-1beta
.

Because
the
promoters
of
these
chemokine
genes
contain
kappaB
binding
sites
,
we
assessed
the
possible
role
of
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
in
controlling
induction
of
the
genes
through
beta
(
2
)
integrin
engagement
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
showed
that
sCD23
or
antibodies
to
CD11b
or
to
CD11c
up-regulated
DNA-binding
activity
of
NF-kappaB
.

Activation
of
NF-kappaB
was
accompanied
by
degradation
of
its
cytosolic
inhibitor
IkappaB-alpha
.

Blockade
of
depletion
of
IkappaB-alpha
by
proteasome
inhibitors
(
proteasome
inhibitor
I
or
acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal
)
led
to
concomitant
inhibition
of
NF-kappaB
DNA-binding
activity
and
expression
of
MIP-1alpha
and
MIP-1beta
messenger
RNA
induced
by
beta
(
2
)
integrin
ligation
.

These
results
suggest
that
triggering
of
CD11b
or
CD11c
beta
(
2
)
integrin
on
primary
human
monocytes
provides
activation
signals
leading
to
nuclear
translocation
of
NF-kappaB
and
subsequent
secretion
of
MIP-1alpha
and
MIP-1beta
that
may
have
an
important
role
in
recruitment
of
other
inflammatory
cells
during
initiation
of
an
inflammatory
response

Interferon-gamma
(
IFN-gamma
)
,
a
cytokine
that
exerts
many
pro-atherosclerotic
effects
in
vivo
,
causes
up-regulation
of
ACAT-1
mRNA
in
human
blood
monocyte-derived
macrophages
and
macrophage-like
cells
but
not
in
other
cell
types
.

To
examine
the
molecular
nature
of
this
observation
,
we
identified
within
the
ACAT-1
P1
promoter
a
159-base
pair
core
region
.

This
region
contains
4
Sp1
elements
and
an
IFN-gamma
activated
sequence
(
GAS
)
that
overlaps
with
the
second
Sp1
element
.

In
the
monocytic
cell
line
THP-1
cell
,
the
combination
of
IFN-gamma
and
all-trans-retinoic
acid
(
a
known
differentiation
agent
)
enhances
the
ACAT-1
P1
promoter
but
not
the
P7
promoter
.

Additional
experiments
showed
that
all-trans-retinoic
acid
causes
large
induction
of
the
transcription
factor
STAT1
,
while
IFN-gamma
causes
activation
of
STAT1
such
that
it
binds
to
the
GAS/Sp1
site
in
the
ACAT-1
P1
promoter
.

Our
work
provides
a
molecular
mechanism
to
account
for
the
effect
of
IFN-gamma
in
causing
transcriptional
activation
of
ACAT-1
in
macrophage-like

Inhaled
nitric
oxide
down-regulates
intrapulmonary
nitric
oxide
production
in
lipopolysaccharide-induced
acute
lung
injury
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
examine
whether
inhaled
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
affected
the
intrapulmonary
production
of
NO
,
reactive
oxygen
species
,
and
nuclear
factor-kappaB
in
a
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-induced
model
of
acute
lung
injury
.

DESIGN
:
Prospective
,
randomized
,
laboratory
study
.

SETTING
:
Experimental
laboratory
at
a
biomedical
institute
.

SUBJECTS
:
Twenty
male
rabbits
weighing
2.5-3.5
kg
.

INTERVENTIONS
:
Saline
or
LPS
(
5
mg/kg
of
body
weight
)
was
administered
intravenously
with
or
without
NO
inhalation
(
10
ppm
)
in
each
group
of
five
rabbits
.

MEASUREMENTS
AND
MAIN
RESULTS
:
LPS
increased
the
lung
leak
index
,
the
neutrophils
and
NO
levels
in
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
,
and
NO
levels
produced
by
resting
and
stimulated
alveolar
macrophages
.

Inhaled
NO
decreased
the
lung
leak
index
,
the
neutrophils
and
NO
levels
as
measured
by
nitrite
levels
in
the
lavage
fluid
,
and
NO
produced
by
the
resting
and
stimulated
alveolar
macrophages
.

Inhaled
NO
also
blocked
the
activities
of
reactive
oxygen
species
and
nuclear
factor-kappaB
binding
to
DNA
in
lavage
cells
and
in
alveolar
macrophages
.

CONCLUSION
:
Inhaled
NO
attenuates
LPS-induced
acute
lung
injury
,
possibly
by
decreasing
NO
production
in
the
lungs
.

The
mechanism
of
reducing
NO
production
resulting
from
inhaled
NO
may
involve
,
in
part
,
the
activities
of
reactive
oxygen
species
and/or
nuclear
factor-kappaB
.

Treatment
of
allergic
airway
inflammation
and
hyperresponsiveness
by
antisense-induced
local
blockade
of
GATA-3
expression
.

Recent
studies
in
transgenic
mice
have
revealed
that
expression
of
a
dominant
negative
form
of
the
transcription
factor
GATA-3
in
T
cells
can
prevent
T
helper
cell
type
2
(
Th2
)
-mediated
allergic
airway
inflammation
in
mice
.

However
,
it
remains
unclear
whether
GATA-3
plays
a
role
in
the
effector
phase
of
allergic
airway
inflammation
and
whether
antagonizing
the
expression
and/or
function
of
GATA-3
can
be
used
for
the
therapy
of
allergic
airway
inflammation
and
hyperresponsiveness
.

Here
,
we
analyzed
the
effects
of
locally
antagonizing
GATA-3
function
in
a
murine
model
of
asthma
.

We
could
suppress
GATA-3
expression
in
interleukin
(
IL
)
-4
-producing
T
cells
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
by
an
antisense
phosphorothioate
oligonucleotide
overlapping
the
translation
start
site
of
GATA-3
,
whereas
nonsense
control
oligonucleotides
were
virtually
inactive
.

In
a
murine
model
of
asthma
associated
with
allergic
pulmonary
inflammation
and
hyperresponsiveness
in
ovalbumin
(
OVA
)
-sensitized
mice
,
local
intranasal
administration
of
fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labeled
GATA-3
antisense
oligonucleotides
led
to
DNA
uptake
in
lung
cells
associated
with
a
reduction
of
intracellular
GATA-3
expression
.

Such
intrapulmonary
blockade
of
GATA-3
expression
caused
an
abrogation
of
signs
of
lung
inflammation
including
infiltration
of
eosinophils
and
Th2
cytokine
production
.

Furthermore
,
treatment
with
antisense
but
not
nonsense
oligonucleotides
induced
a
significant
reduction
of
airway
hyperresponsiveness
in
OVA-sensitized
mice
to
levels
comparable
to
saline-treated
control
mice
,
as
assessed
by
both
enhanced
pause
(
PenH
)
responses
and
pulmonary
resistance
determined
by
body
plethysmography
.

These
data
indicate
a
critical
role
for
GATA-3
in
the
effector
phase
of
a
murine
asthma
model
and
suggest
that
local
delivery
of
GATA-3
antisense
oligonucleotides
may
be
a
novel
approach
for
the
treatment
of
airway
hyperresponsiveness
such
as
in
asthma
.

This
approach
has
the
potential
advantage
of
suppressing
the
expression
of
various
proinflammatory
Th2
cytokines
simultaneously
rather
than
suppressing
the
activity
of
a
single
cytokine
.

T
helper-cell
phenotype
regulates
atherosclerosis
in
mice
under
conditions
of
mild
hypercholesterolemia
.

BACKGROUND
:
T
cells
are
implicated
in
atherosclerosis
,
but
little
is
known
about
the
genetic
control
or
molecular
pathways
,
especially
under
conditions
of
mild
hypercholesterolemia
.

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
BALB/c
mice
,
making
a
CD4+
Th2
(
IL-4+
)
cell
response
,
express
both
MHC
class
II
antigens
(
IA
(
d
)
,
IE
(
d
)
)
and
are
atherosclerosis-resistant
.

C57Bl/6
mice
produce
a
CD4+
Th1
(
interferon
[
IFN
]
gamma+
)
response
,
express
IA
(
b
)
but
no
IE
,
and
are
atherosclerosis-prone
.

To
evaluate
T

in
fatty

formation
,
wild-type
C57Bl/6
mice
(
IA
(

)
+IE-
)
and
transgenic
mice
,
either
AB
(

;
or
BL

,
were
fed
a
high-cholesterol
diet
for
16
weeks
and
evaluated
histomorphometrically
for
aortic
lesions
.

Lesion
size
in
AB
(

)
,
ABEalpha
,
and
BL

strains
was
decreased
by
54
%
,
79
%
,
and
82
%
,
respectively
,
compared
with
wild-type
,
correlating
with
decreased
Th1
and
increased
Th2
expression
and
suggesting
that
T
helper-cell
phenotype
is
important
in
fatty
lesion
development
.

Decreasing
Th1
cells
by
antibodies
(
alpha-CD4
)
or
cytokines
(
IL-4
)
also
caused
>
/=80
%
reductions
in
lesion
size
.

Immunohistology
revealed
IFN-gamma
,
but
not
IL-4
,
colocalized
with
activated
macrophages
.

Confirming
these
findings
in
a
different
mouse
strain
,
BALB/c
Stat
6
knockout
mice
(
Th2
cell-deficient
)
developed
aortic
lesions
comparable
to
C57Bl/6
mice
on
the
same
diet
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
mildly
hypercholesterolemic
C57Bl/6
mice
,
presence
of
IA
(
b
)
and
absence
of
IE
regulated
CD4+
T
helper-cell
phenotype
;
fatty
lesions
were
proportional
to
IFNgamma+
Th1
cells
in
both
C57Bl/6
and
BALB/c
strains
.

IFN-gamma
may
participate
through
macrophage
activation
,
whereas
IL-4
may
act
to
limit
Th1-cell
response
.

signal-transducing
receptor
for
AGE
(
RAGE
)
has
been
linked
to
a
proinflammatory
phenotypic
change
within
cells
.

However
,
the
precise
intracellular
signaling
pathways
involved
have
not
been
elucidated
.

We
demonstrate
here
that
human
serum
albumin
modified
with
N
(
varepsilon
)
-
(
carboxymethyl
)
lysine
(
CML
)
,
a
major
AGE
adduct
that
progressively
accumulates
with
aging
,
diabetes
,
and
renal
failure
,
induced
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappaB
-driven
reporter
gene
expression
in
human
monocytic
THP-1
cells
.

The
NF-kappaB
response
was
blocked
with
a
synthetic
peptide
corresponding
to
the
putative
ligand-binding
domain
of
RAGE
,
with
anti-
RAGE
antiserum
,
and
by
coexpression
of
truncated
receptors
lacking
the
intracellular
domain
.

Signal
transduction
from
RAGE
to
NF-kappaB
involved
the
generation
of
reactive
oxygen
species
,
since
reporter
gene
expression
was
blocked
with
the
antioxidant
N-acetyl-L-cysteine
.

CML-modified
albumin
produced
rapid
transient
activation
of
tyrosine
phosphorylation
,
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
1
and
2
,
and
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
,
but
not
c-Jun
NH
(
2
)
-terminal
kinase
.

RAGE
-mediated
NF-kappaB
activation
was
suppressed
by
the
selective
p38
MAPK
inhibitor
SB203580
and
by
coexpression
of
a
kinase-dead
p38
dominant-negative
mutant
.

Activation
of
NF-kappaB
by
CML-modified
albumin
increased
secretion
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
(
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
interleukin-1beta
,
and
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
)
severalfold
,
and
inhibition
of
p38
MAPK
blocked
these
increases
.

These
results
indicate
that
p38
MAPK
activation
mediates
RAGE
-induced
NF-kappaB
-dependent
secretion
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
and
suggest
that
accelerated
inflammation
may
be
a
consequence
of
cellular
activation
induced
by
this
receptor
.

Antigen-receptor
cross-linking
and
lipopolysaccharide
trigger
distinct
phosphoinositide
3-kinase
-dependent
pathways
to
NF-kappa
B
activation
in
primary
B
cells
.

The
NF-kappaB/Rel
transcription
factors
play
an
important
role
in
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
B
cell
development
,
differentiation
and
function
.

Nuclear
NF-kappaB
is
induced
in
B
cells
by
engagement
of
either
the
BCR
or
CD40
or
by
stimulation
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
.

Despite
the
importance
of
NF-kappaB
to
B
cell
function
,
little
is
known
about
the
signaling
pathways
leading
to
NF-kappaB
activation
.

In
this
report
we
address
the
role
of
phosphoinositide
3'-kinase
(
PI
3-kinase
)
in
BCR
-
and
LPS-induced
NF-kappaB
activation
using
populations
of
primary
murine
resting
B
cells
.

Using
the
specific
pharmacological
inhibitors
of
PI
3-kinase
,
Wortmannin
and
LY294002
,
we
demonstrate
that
PI
3-kinase
activity
is
vital
for
BCR
-induced
NF-kappaB
DNA-binding
activity
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
this
is
achieved
via
protein
kinase
C
-dependent
degradation
of
IkappaBalpha
.

Similar
analyses
reveal
that
PI
3-kinase
is
also
critical
in
triggering
NF-kappaB
DNA-binding
activity
and
IkappaBalpha
degradation
following
LPS
stimulation
.

Interestingly
,
a
PKC
inhibitor
which
blocked
the
BCR
-induced
IkappaBalpha
degradation
had
no
effect
on
the
degradation
of
IkappaBalpha
after
LPS
stimulation
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
indicate
the
involvement
of
PI
3-kinase
in
at
least
two
distinct
signaling
pathways
leading
to
activation
of
NF-kappaB
in
B
cells
.

Tetramer-guided
epitope
mapping
:
rapid
identification
and
characterization
of
immunodominant
CD4+
T
cell
epitopes
from
complex
antigens
.

T
cell
responses
to
Ags
involve
recognition
of
selected
peptide
epitopes
contained
within
the
antigenic
protein
.

In
this
report
,
we
describe
a
new
approach
for
direct
identification
of
CD4+
T
cell
epitopes
of
complex
Ags
that
uses
human
class
II
tetramers
to
identify
reactive
cells
.

With
a
panel
of
60
overlapping
peptides
covering
the
entire
sequence
of
the
VP16
protein
,
a
major
Ag
for
HSV-2
,
we
generated
a
panel
of
class
II
MHC
tetramers
loaded
with
peptide
pools
that
were
used
to
stain
peripheral
lymphocytes
of
an
HSV-2
infected
individual
.

With
this
approach
,
we
identified
four
new
DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401-
and
two
DRA1*0101/DRB1*0404-restricted
,
VP16-specific
epitopes
.

By
using
tetramers
to
sort
individual
cells
,
we
easily
obtained
a
large
number
of
clones
specific
to
these
epitopes
.

Although
DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401
and
DRA1*0101/DRB1*0404
are
structurally
very
similar
,
nonoverlapping
VP16
epitopes
were
identified
,
illustrating
high
selectivity
of
individual
allele
polymorphisms
within
common
MHC
variants
.

This
rapid
approach
to
detecting
CD4+
T
cell
epitopes
from
complex
Ags
can
be
applied
to
any
known
Ag
that
gives
a
T
cell
response

Localized
pancreatic
NF-kappaB
activation
and
inflammatory
response
in
taurocholate-induced
pancreatitis
.

Transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
is
activated
in
cerulein
pancreatitis
and
mediates
cytokine
expression
.

The
role
of
transcription
factor
activation
in
other
models
of
pancreatitis
has
not
been
established
.

Here
we
report
upregulation
of
NF-kappaB
and
inflammatory
molecules
,
and
their
correlation
with
local
pancreatic
injury
,
in
a
model
of
severe
pancreatitis
.

Rats
received
intraductal
infusion
of
taurocholate
or
saline
,
and
the
pancreatic
head
and
tail
were
analyzed
separately
.

NF-kappaB
and
activator
protein-1
(
AP-1
)
activation
were
assessed
by
gel
shift
assay
,
and
mRNA
expression
of
interleukin-6
,
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
KC
,
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
,
and
inducible
nitric
oxide
synthase
was
assessed
by
semiquantitative
RT-PCR
.

Morphological
damage
and
trypsin
activation
were
much
greater
in
the
pancreatic
head
than
tail
,
in
parallel
with
a
stronger
activation
of
NF-kappaB
and
cytokine
mRNA
.

Saline
infusion
mildly
affected
these
parameters
.

AP-1
was
strongly
activated
in
both
pancreatic
segments
after
either
taurocholate
or
saline
infusion
.

NF-kappaB
inhibition
with
N-acetylcysteine
ameliorated
the
local
inflammatory
response
.

Correlation
between
localized
NF-kappaB
activation
,
cytokine
upregulation
,
and
tissue
damage
suggests
a
key
role
for
NF-kappaB
in
the
development
of
the
inflammatory
response
of
acute
pancreatitis
.

CD45
tyrosine
phosphatase
controls
common
gamma-chain
cytokine
-mediated
STAT
and
extracellular
signal-related
kinase
phosphorylation
in
activated
human
lymphoblasts
:
inhibition
of
proliferation
without
induction
of
apoptosis
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
test
whether
CD45
signals
can
influence
signaling
processes
in
activated
human
lymphoblasts
.

To
this
end
,
we
generated
lymphoblasts
which
proliferate
in
response
to
common
gamma-chain
cytokines
,
but
readily
undergo
apoptosis
after
cytokine
withdrawal
.

In
experiments
with
the
CD45R0
mAb
UCHL-1
,
but
not
control
CD45
mAbs
,
we
found
significant
inhibition
of
proliferation
.

Interestingly
,
the
pan-CD45
mAb
GAP8.3
,
which
is
most
effective
in
inhibition
of
OKT-3-mediated
proliferation
in
quiescent
lymphocytes
,
was
ineffective
in
lymphoblasts
.

Addition
of
CD3
mAb
OKT-3
had
no
influence
on
IL-2-mediated
proliferation
(
with
or
without
UCHL-1
)
.

In
contrast
,
after
addition
of
OKT-3
to
IL-4
-
and
IL-7
-stimulated
proliferation
assays
,
UCHL-1
signals
could
not
significantly
alter
cellular
proliferation
.

We
did
not
find
induction
of
apoptosis
following
CD45R0
signaling
.

In
Western
blots
using
mAbs
detecting
phosphorylated
STAT-3
,
STAT-5
,
STAT-6
,
or
extracellular
signal-related
kinase
1/2
,
we
found
that
CD45R0
signaling
could
effectively
diminish
phosphorylation
of
these
intracellular
signaling
components
.

Using
RT-PCR
,
we
found
that
CD45R0
signaling
inhibited
IL-2
mRNA
production
without
major
influence
on
IL-13
,
IL-5
,
or
IFN-gamma
mRNA
levels
.

Costimulation
with
OKT-3
and
IL-2
optimally
induced
secretion
of
IFN-gamma
,
TNF-alpha
,
and
IL-5
,
which
was
not
decreased
by
CD45
signals
.

In
conclusion
,
we
illustrate
that
CD45R0
signals
control
early
cytokine
receptor-associated
signaling
processes
and
mRNA
and
DNA
synthesis
in
activated
human
lymphoblasts
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
the
existence
of
CD45
epitopes
(
GAP8.3
)
,
which
are
active
and
critical
for
signaling
in
quiescent
lymphocytes
,
but
are
nonfunctional
in
activated
human
lymphoblasts
.

Pax5
determines
the
identity
of
B
cells
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
B-lymphopoiesis
.

Despite
being
one
of
the
most
intensively
studied
cell
types
,
the
molecular
basis
of
B
cell
specification
is
largely
unknown
.

The
Pax5
gene
encoding
the
transcription
factor
BSAP
is
required
for
progression
of
B-lymphopoiesis
beyond
the
pro-B
cell
stage
.

Pax5-deficient
pro-B
cells
are
,
however
,
not
yet
committed
to
the
B-lymphoid
lineage
,
but
instead
have
a
broad
lymphomyeloid
developmental
potential
.

Pax5
appears
to
mediate
B-lineage
commitment
by
repressing
the
transcription
of
non-B-lymphoid
genes
and
by
simultaneously
activating
the
expression
of
B-lineage-specific
genes
.

Pax5
thus
functions
both
as
a
transcriptional
repressor
and
activator
,
depending
on
its
interactions
with
corepressors
of
the
Groucho
protein
family
or
with
positive
regulators
such
as
the
TATA-binding
protein
.

Once
committed
to
the
B-lineage
,
B
cells
require
Pax5
function
to
maintain
their
B-lymphoid
identity
throughout
B
cell
development

Partners
in
transcription
:
NFAT
and
AP-1
.

Combinatorial
regulation
is
a
powerful
mechanism
that
enables
tight
control
of
gene
expression
,
via
integration
of
multiple
signaling
pathways
that
induce
different
transcription
factors
required
for
enhanceosome
assembly
.

The
four
calcium-regulated
transcription
factors
of
the
NFAT
family
act
synergistically
with
AP-1
(
Fos/Jun
)
proteins
on
composite
DNA
elements
which
contain
adjacent
NFAT
and
AP-1
binding
sites
,
where
they
form
highly
stable
ternary
complexes
to
regulate
the
expression
of
diverse
inducible
genes
.

Concomitant
induction
of
NFAT
and
AP-1
requires
concerted
activation
of
two
different
signaling
pathways
:
calcium/calcineurin
,
which
promotes
NFAT
dephosphorylation
,
nuclear
translocation
and
activation
;
and
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
/Ras
,
which
promotes
the
synthesis
,
phosphorylation
and
activation
of
members
of
the
Fos
and
Jun
families
of
transcription
factors
.

A
fifth
member
of
the
NFAT
family
,
NFAT5
,
controls
the
cellular
response
to
osmotic
stress
,
by
a
mechanism
that
requires
dimer
formation
and
is
independent
of
calcineurin
or
of
interaction
with
AP-1
.

Pharmacological
interference
with
theNFAT
:
AP-1
interaction
may
be
useful
in
selective
manipulation
of
the
immune
response
.

Balanced
activation
of
NFAT
and
AP-1
is
known
to
be
required
for
productive
immune
responses
,
but
the
role
of
NFAT
:
AP-1
interactions
in
other
cell
types
and
biological
processes
remains
to
be
understood
.

Two

differ
by
a

H3
induces
severe
myocarditis
in

,
but

is
amyocarditic
.

Infection
with

preferentially
activates

,
which
are

The
role
of

was

by
adoptively
transferring
these

mice
into

from

expressed

no

IFN-gamma
,
whereas

neither

These

show
that

control

bias
the

The

Plasmin
-induced
expression
of
cytokines
and
tissue
factor
in
human
monocytes
involves
AP-1
and
IKKbeta
-mediated
NF-kappaB
activation
.

It
was
previously
shown
that
plasmin
activates
human
peripheral
monocytes
in
terms
of
lipid
mediator
release
and
chemotactic
migration
.

Here
it
is
demonstrated
that
plasmin
induces
proinflammatory
cytokine
release
and
tissue
factor
(
TF
)
expression
by
monocytes
.

Plasmin
0.043
to
1.43
CTA
U/mL
,
but
not
active
site-blocked
plasmin
,
triggered
concentration-dependent
expression
of
mRNA
for
interleukin-1alpha
(
IL-1alpha
)
,
IL-1beta
,
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
,
and
TF
with
maximum
responses
after
4
hours
.

Plasmin
-mediated
mRNA
expression
was
inhibited
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
by
the
lysine
analogue
trans-4-
(
aminomethyl
)
cyclohexane-1-carboxylic
acid
(
t-AMCA
)
.

Increases
in
mRNA
levels
were
followed
by
concentration-
and
time-dependent
release
of
IL-1alpha
,
IL-1beta
and
TNF-alpha
and
by
TF
expression
on
monocyte
surfaces
.

Neither
cytokines
nor
TF
could
be
detected
when
monocytes
were
preincubated
with
actinomycin
D
or
cycloheximide
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
indicated
plasmin
-induced
activation
of
NF-kappaB
;
DNA-binding
complexes
were
composed
of
p50
,
p65
,
and
c-Rel
,
as
shown
by
supershift
experiments
.

Nuclear
translocation
of
NF-kappaB/Rel
proteins
coincided
with
IkappaBalpha
degradation
.

At
variance
with
endotoxic
lipopolysaccharide
,
plasmin
elicited
the
rapid
degradation
of
another
cytoplasmic
NF-kappaB
inhibitor
,
p105
.

Proteolysis
of
NF-kappaB
inhibitors
was
apparently
due
to
transient
activation
of
IkappaB
kinase
(
IKK
)
beta
that
reached
maximum
activity
at
1
hour
after
plasmin
stimulation
.

In
addition
,
AP-1
binding
was
increased
in
plasmin
-treated
monocytes
,
with
most
complexes
composed
of
JunD
,
c-Fos
,
and
FosB
.

These
findings
further
substantiate
the
role
of
plasmin
as
a
proinflammatory
activator
of
human
monocytes
and
reveal
an
important
new
link
between
the
plasminogen-plasmin
system
and
inflammation
.

of
this
disease
remains
unknown
.

Growth
factor
hypersensitivity
could
be
mediated
by
changes
in
signal
transduction
pathways
.

We
therefore
investigated
a
common
downstream
effector
of
cytokines
,
the
signal
transducers
and
activators
of
transcription
(
STATs
)
.

A
constitutive
activation
of
STAT
factors
could
explain
the
increased
proliferation
of
P.
vera
cells
even
in
the
absence
of
growth
factor
stimulation
.

METHODS
:
Peripheral
granulocytes
from
patients
with
P.
vera
and
from
healthy
volunteers
were
assayed
for
STAT1
,
3
,
and
5
DNA
binding
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
.

RESULTS
:
Four
of
14
P.
vera
patients
analyzed
showed
constitutive
STAT3
DNA
binding
in
unstimulated
peripheral
granulocytes
,
while
none
of
the
17
healthy
volunteers
tested
did
.

None
of
the
subjects
showed
constitutive
STAT1
or
STAT5
activity
.

Western
blotting
demonstrated
that
,
in
the
three
patients
,
STAT3
is
constitutively
phosphorylated
on
Tyr
705
,
whereas
it
is
unphosphorylated
in
the
other
patients
and
in
controls
.

Interestingly
,
constitutive
STAT3
activity
did
not
correlate
with
the
duration
of
disease
or
the
treatment
regimen
.

It
was
observed
in
a
recently
diagnosed
patient
and
in
two
patients
treated
only
with
phlebotomy
.

CONCLUSION
:
Our
data
suggest
that
constitutive
phosphorylation
and
activation
of
STAT3
is
not
a
secondary
event
induced
by
mutagenizing
agents
or
by
prolonged
hyperproliferation
of
hematopoietic
cells
,
but
rather
represents
a
primary
molecular
aberration
.

Constitutively
active
STAT3
may
contribute
to
the
growth
factor
hypersensitivity
of
P.
vera
cells
.

Identification
of
phosphorylation
sites
for
Bruton
's
tyrosine
kinase
within
the
transcriptional
regulator
BAP/TFII-I
.

Bruton
's
tyrosine
kinase
(
Btk
)
,
a
member
of
the
Tec
family
of
cytosolic
kinases
,
is
essential
for
B
cell
development
and
function
.

BAP/TFII-I
,
a
protein
implicated
in
transcriptional
regulation
,
is
associated
with
Btk
in
B
cells
and
is
transiently
phosphorylated
on
tyrosine
following
B
cell
receptor
engagement
.

BAP/TFII-I
is
a
substrate
for
Btk
in
vitro
and
is
hyperphosphorylated
on
tyrosine
upon
coexpression
with
Btk
in
mammalian
cells
.

In
an
effort
to
understand
the
physiologic
consequences
of
BAP/TFII-I
tyrosine
phosphorylation
following
B
cell
receptor
stimulation
,
site-directed
mutagenesis
and
phosphopeptide
mapping
were
used
to
locate
the
predominant
sites
of
BAP/TFII-I
phosphorylation
by
Btk
in
vitro
.

These
residues
,
Tyr248
,
Tyr357
,
and
Tyr462
,
were
also
found
to
be
the
major
sites
for
Btk
-dependent
phosphorylation
of
BAP/TFII-I
in
vivo
.

Residues
Tyr357
and
Tyr462
are
contained
within
the
loop
regions
of
adjacent
helix-loop-helix-like
repeats
within
BAP/TFII-I
.

Mutation
of
either
Tyr248
,
Tyr357
,
or
Tyr462
to
phenylalanine
reduced
transcription
from
a
c-fos
promoter
relative
to
wild-type
BAP/TFII-I
in
transfected
COS-7
cells
,
consistent
with
the
interpretation
that
phosphorylation
at
these
sites
contributes
to
transcriptional
activation
.

Phosphorylation
of
BAP/TFII-I
by
Btk
may
link
engagement
of
receptors
such
as
surface
immunoglobulin
to
modulation
of
gene
expression
.

Expression

Mice
deficient
in
the
interferon

sequence
binding
protein
(
ICSBP
)
develop
a
disease
resembling
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
which
in
humans
is
caused
by
the
BCR/ABL
oncoprotein
.

Interferon-alpha
(
IFN-alpha
)
induces
ICSBP
expression
and
is
an
effective
therapy
for
CML
.

This
study
examined
whether
enforced
expression
of
ICSBP
might
antagonize
BCR/ABL-induced
leukemia
;
results
demonstrated
that
ICSBP-modified
cells
generated
a
protective
CD8
(
+
)
cytotoxic
T-cell
response
against
BCR/ABL-transformed
BaF3
cells
in
a
murine
leukemia
model
.

ICSBP
expression
represents
a
novel
means
of
stimulating
a
host
immune
response
to
BCR/ABL
(

)
leukemia
cells
and
a
potential
strategy
for
immunotherapy
of
CML
.

Both

However

not
produce
sufficient
IL-2

,

depend
on

for
this
obligate

IL-2

in

at
the
level

mechanisms
restricting

have
not

To

had
a

in

of

of
the
native

restored

.

These
results
suggest
that
the
defect
at
the

may
reflect
the
absence

inactivity
of
a
required

Distinct
BMI-1
and
EZH2
expression
patterns
in
thymocytes
and
mature
T
cells
suggest
a
role
for
Polycomb
genes
in
human
T
cell
differentiation
.

BMI-1
and
EZH2
Polycomb-group
(
PcG
)
proteins
belong
to
two
distinct
protein
complexes
involved
in
the
regulation
of
hematopoiesis
.

Using
unique
PcG-specific
antisera
and
triple
immunofluorescence
,
we
found
that
mature
resting
peripheral
T
cells
expressed
BMI-1
,
whereas
dividing
blasts
were
EZH2
(

.

By

,
subcapsular

DN
)

CD4

while

)
medullar
thymocytes
correlated
with
decreased
detectability
of
EZH2
and
continued
relative
absence
of
BMI-1
.

Our
data
show
that
BMI-1
and
EZH2
expression
in
mature
peripheral
T
cells
is
mutually
exclusive
and
linked
to
proliferation
status
,
and
that
this
pattern
is
not
yet
established
in
thymocytes
of
the
cortex
and
medulla
.

T
cell
stage-specific
PcG
expression
profiles
suggest
that
PcG
genes
contribute
to
regulation
of
T
cell
differentiation
.

They
probably
reflect
stabilization
of
cell
type-specific
gene
expression
and
irreversibility
of
lineage
choice
.

The
difference
in
PcG
expression
between
medullar

indicates
that
additional

Stepwise

of

It
has
long
been
controversial
whether
hematopoiesis
progresses
through
ordered
stages
of
determination
as
in
embryonic
development
.

This
is
due
to
the
absence
of
a
methodology
capable
of
exactly
determining
the
developmental
potential
of
hematopoietic
stem/progenitor
cells
.

The
multilineage
progenitor
(
MLP
)
assay
enabled
us
to
discriminate
among
seven
types
of
hematopoietic
progenitors
,
which
are
multipotent
progenitor
p-MTB
(
capable
of
generating
myeloid
,
T
and
B
cells
)
,
bipotent
progenitors
p-MT
,
p-MB
and
p-TB
,
and
unipotent
progenitors
p-M
,
p-T
and
p-B
.

Among
these
seven
types
,
the
p-TB
type
progenitor
was
found
to
be
absent
.

These
findings
indicate
that
the
process
of
lineage
commitment
proceeds
through
an
ordered
but
not
random
process
.

By
extending
the
area
of
investigation
to
include
the
erythroid
lineage
,
more
convincing
evidence
for
the
ordered
process
was
obtained
.

Detailed
and
exact
illustration
of
the
process
of
hematopoiesis
will
provide
an
opportunity
to
revive
hematopoiesis

of
the

of

Epstein-Barr
Virus
and
its
glycoprotein-350
upregulate
IL-6
in
human
B-lymphocytes
via
CD21
,
involving
activation
of
NF-kappaB
and
different
signaling
pathways
.

Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
is
a
ubiquitous
and
highly
immunotropic
gamma
herpesvirus
that
infects
more
than
90
%
of
humans
worldwide
.

Its
pathogenicity
leads
to
a
number
of
diseases
including
tumors
that
result
from
EBV
's
ability
to
readily
transform
B-lymphocytes
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
epithelial
cells
.

EBV
utilizes
CD21/CR2
as
its
receptor
on
B
cells
to
initiate
the
infection
process
.

EBV
binds
to
CR2
through
its
major
envelope
glycoprotein-350
(
gp350
)
and
is
also
a
remarkable
immunomodulating
agent
.

We
had
previously
shown
that
EBV
is
capable
of
modulating
the
synthesis
of
a
number
of
cytokines
.

We
now
show
that
while
both
purified
recombinant
gp350
(
rgp350
)
and
EBV
upregulate
IL-6
mRNA
synthesis
in
B
cells
,
EBV-induced
IL-6
gene
activation
occurs
for
a
significantly
longer
period
of
time
(
i.e.
12
hours
for
EBV
as
compared
to
6
hours
for
rgp350
)
.

Moreover
,
the
half-life
of
EBV-induced
IL-6
mRNA
was
also
significantly
longer
(
10
hours
)
than
that
of
mRNA
induced
by
rgp350
(
about
6
hours
)
.

Both
EBV
and
gp350
enhance
the
binding
of
the
NF-kappaB
transcription
factor
,
as
determined
by
band-shift
and
augment
NF-kappaB
-mediated
activation
of
a
CAT
reporter
plasmid
.

Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that
while
the
activation
of
IL-6
gene
expression
by
gp350
is
mediated
primarily
by
the
protein
kinase
C
pathway
,
EBV
can
mediate
its
effects
through
multiple
signaling
pathways
.

To
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
report
showing
that
the
binding
of
a
herpesvirus
envelope
glycoprotein
to
CR2
on
human
B
cells
results
in
the
activation
of
the
NF-kappaB
transcription
factor
leading
to
the
upregulation
of
IL-6
gene
expression
in
these
lymphocytes

Gene-
and
tissue-specificity
of
mutation
in
Big
Blue
rats
treated
with
the
hepatocarcinogen
N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene
.

In
a
previous
study
,
we
found
that
treating
transgenic
Big
Blue
rats
with
the
hepatocarcinogen
N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene
(
N-OH-AAF
)
produced
the
same
major
DNA

in
the
target
liver
and
the
nontarget
spleen
lymphocytes
and
bone
marrow
cells
,
induced
lacI
mutants
in
the
liver
,
and
induced
much
lower
frequencies
of
l
acI
and
hprt
mutants
in
spleen
lymphocytes
.

In
the
present
study
,
sequence
analysis
was
conducted
on
lacI
DNA
and
hprt
cDNA
from
the
mutants
,
to
determine
the
mutational
specificity
of
N-OH-AAF
in
the
rat
.

All
the
mutation
spectra
from
N-OH-AAF-treated
rats
differed
significantly
from
corresponding
mutation
profiles
from
untreated
animals
(
P
=
0.02
to
P
<
0.0001
)
.

Although
there
were
similarities
among
the
mutational
patterns
derived
from
N-OH-AAF-treated
rats
(
e.g.
,
G
:
C
--
>
T
:
A
transversion
was
the
most
common
mutation
in
all
mutation
sets
)
,
there
were
significant
differences
in
the
patterns
of
basepair
substitution
and
frameshift
mutation
between
the
liver
and
spleen
lymphocyte
lacI
mutants
(
P
=
0.02
)
and
between
the
spleen
lymphocyte
lacI
and
hprt
mutants
(
P
=
0.04
)
.

Also
,
multiplex
PCR
analysis
of
genomic
DNA
from
the
hprt
mutants
indicated
that
12
%
of
mutants
from
treated
rats
had
major
deletions
in
the
hprt
gene
;
no
corresponding
incidence
of
large
deletions
was
evident
among
lacI
mutations
.

All
the
mutation
profiles
reflect
the
general
mutational
specificity
of
the
major
DNA
adduct
formed
by
N-OH-AAF
.

The
differences
between
N-OH-AAF
mutation
in
the
endogenous
gene
and
transgene
can
be
partially
explained
by
the
structures
of
the
two
genes
.

The
tissue-specificity
of
the
mutation
spectra
may
contribute
to
targeting
tumor
formation
to
the
liver

Caspase
-dependent
cleavage
of
the
hematopoietic
specific

Gads

from

Gads
is

SH3
domain
-containing
,
hematopoietic-specific
adaptor
protein
that
functions
in
signalling
from
the
T

Gads
acts
by
linking
SLP-76
,
bound
by
the
carboxy-terminal
Gads
SH3
domain
,
to
tyrosine
phosphorylated
LAT
which
contains
binding
sites
for
the
Gads
SH2
domain
.

Gads
is
distinguished
from
Grb2

the

the
presence
of
a
120
amino
acid
unique
region

the
SH2

and
the
carboxy

SH3
domain
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
the
unique
region
of
Gads
contains
a
capase
cleavage
site
.

Induction
of

in

cleavage
by

.

Gads
cleavage
is
blocked
in
vivo
by
treating
cells
with
a
caspase
3
inhibitor
.

A
putative
caspase
3
cleavage
site
was
identified
within
the
unique
region
and
mutation
of
this
site
prevented
Gads
cleavage
in

and
in

.

The
Gads
cleavage
products
retained
the

.

Expression
of
the
Gads
cleavage
products

These
findings

to

T-cells
.

In
this
report
,
we
explore
the
mechanisms
of
targeting
of
p300
to
the
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
promoter
in
response
to
mitogenic
and
oncogenic
molecular
signals
.

Recruitment
of
p300
by
cAMP-responsive
element-binding
protein-Rel
cross-talk
at
the
composite
CD28
response
element
(
CD28RE
)
-
TRE
element
of
the
IL-2
promoter
is
essential
for
promoter
inducibility
during
T-cell
activation
,
and
CD28RE-TRE
is
the
exclusive
target
of
the
human
T-cell
lymphotropic
virus
type
I
oncoprotein
Tax
.

The
intrinsic
histone
acetyltransferase
activity
of
p300
is
dispensable
for
activation
of
the
IL-2
promoter
,
and
the
N-terminal
743
residues
contain
the
minimal
structural
requirements
for
synergistic
transactivation
of
the
CD28RE-TRE
,
the
IL-2
promoter
,
and
endogenous
IL-2
gene
expression
.

Mutational
analysis
of
p300
reveals
differential
structural
requirements
for
the
N-terminal
p300
module
by
individual
cis-elements
within
the
IL-2
promoter
.

These
findings
provide
evidence
that
p300
assembles
at
the
IL-2
promoter
to
form
an
enhanceosome-like
signal
transduction
target
that
is
centrally
integrated
at
the
CD28RE-TRE
element
of
the
IL-2
promoter
through
specific
protein
module-targeted
associations
in
activated
T-cells
.

Regulation
of
cytokine
production
in
T-cell
responses
to
inhalant
allergen
:
GATA-3
expression
distinguishes
between
Th1-
and
Th2-polarized
immunity
.

BACKGROUND
:
The
precise
nature
of
allergen-specific
cytokine
responses
in
atopics
versus
non-atopics
,
in
particular
the
'Th1
polarity
'
of
responses
in
non-atopics
,
remains
controversial
.

This
is
due
in
part
to
the
relative
insensitivity
of
cytokine
detection
systems
,
and
associated
variations
in
kinetics
of
cytokine
production
and
catabolism
in
in
vitro
culture
systems
.

As
an
alternative
to
cytokine
measurement
,
this
study
focuses
on
expression
of
the
transcription
factor
GATA-3
for
analysis
of
allergen-specific
Th
cell
responses
.

METHODS
:
Cord
blood
mononuclear
cells
were
Th1-
or
Th2-polarized
by
culture
in
IL-12-
or
IL-4-employing
established
methods
;
PBMC
from
house
dust
mite
(
HDM
)
-sensitive
atopics
and
controls
were
stimulated
overnight
with
HDM
;
cytokine
production
was
measured
by
ELISA
and
GATA-3
mRNA
expression
by
PCR
.

RESULTS
:
Cytokine
-driven
Th2
polarization
of
naive
T
cells
is
associated
with
marked
upregulation
of
GATA-3
expression
,
whereas
a
reciprocal
expression
pattern
accompanies
differentiation
towards
the
Th1
cytokine
phenotype
.

In
T
cells
from
HDM
skin
prick
test-positive
(
HDM-SPT+/HDM-IgE+
)
volunteers
,
overnight
stimulation
results
in
marked
upregulation
of
GATA-3
expression
,
compared
to
an
equally
marked
downregulation
of
expression
in
T
cells
from
SPT-/IgE-
subjects
.

In
subjects
who
are
HDM-SPT+
but
IgE-
,
GATA-3
expression
levels
remained
relatively
stable
during
culture
with
HDM
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Upregulation
of
GATA-3
expression
in
PBMC
is
a
hallmark
of
the
early
phase
of
Th2
recall
responses
to
specific
allergen
in
atopics
.

The
reciprocal
expression
pattern
observed
in
HDM-specific
recall
responses
of
non-atopics
provides
independent
confirmation
of
the
presence
of
underlying
Th1-like
immunity
in
these
subjects
.

The
parallel
findings
in
neonatal
T
cells
suggest
that
the
same
approach
may
be
utilized
for
monitoring
the
progress
of
allergen-specific
Th1/Th2
memory
development
during
early
childhood
,
and
hence
in
assessment
of
risk
for
future
allergic
disease
.

The
heat
shock
response
reduces
myelin
oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein
-induced
experimental
autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
in
mice
.

The
stress
response
(
SR
)
can
block
inflammatory
gene
expression
by
preventing
activation
of
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(
NF-kappaB
)
.

As
inflammatory
gene
expression
contributes
to
the
pathogenesis
of
demyelinating
diseases
,
we
tested
the
effects
of
the
SR
on
the
progression
of
the
demyelinating
disease
experimental
autoimmune
encephalomyelitis
(
EAE
)
.

EAE
was
actively
induced
in
C57BL/6
mice
using
an
encephalitogenic
myelin
oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein
(
MOG
(
35-55
)
)
peptide
.

Whole
body
hyperthermia
was
used
to
induce
a
heat
shock
response
(
HSR
)
in
immunized
mice
2
days
after
the
booster
MOG
(
35-55
)
peptide
injection
.

The
HSR
reduced
the
incidence
of
EAE
by
70
%
,
delayed
disease
onset
by
6
days
,
and
attenuated
disease
severity
.

The
HSR
attenuated
leukocyte
infiltration
into
CNS
assessed
by
quantitation
of
perivascular
infiltrates
,
and
by
reduced
staining
for
CD4
and
CD25
immunopositive
T-cells
.

T-cell
activation
,
assessed
by
the
production
of
interferon
gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
in
response
to
MOG
(
35-55
)
,
was
also
decreased
by
the
HSR
.

The
HSR
reduced
inflammatory
gene
expression
in
the
brain
that
normally
occurs
during
EAE
,
including
the
early
increase
in
RANTES
(
regulated
on
activation
of
normal
T-cell
expressed
and
secreted
)
expression
,
and
the
later
expression
of
the
inducible
form
of
nitric
oxide
synthase
.

The
early
activation
of
transcription
factor
NF-kappaB
was
also
blocked
by
the
HSR
.

The
finding
that
the
SR
reduces
inflammation
in
the
brain
and
the
clinical
severity
of
EAE
opens
a
novel
therapeutic
approach
for
prevention
of
autoimmune
diseases
.

In
vivo
detection
of
intracellular
signaling
pathways
in
developing
thymocytes
.

Information
regarding
the
intracellular
signaling
processes
that
occur
during
the
development
of
T
cells
has
largely
been
obtained
with
the
use
of
transgenic
mouse
models
,
which
although
providing
invaluable
information
are
time
consuming
and
costly
.

To
this
end
,
we
have
developed
a
novel
system
that
facilitates
the
in
vivo
analysis
of
signal
transduction
pathways
during
T-lymphocyte
development
.

This
approach
uses
reporter-plasmids
for
the
detection
of
intracellular
signals
mediated
by
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
or
cyclic
AMP-dependent
protein
kinase
.

Reporter-plasmids
are
transfected
into
thymocytes
in
fetal
thymic
organ
culture
by
accelerated
DNA/particle
bombardment
(
gene
gun
)
,
and
the
activation
of
a
signaling
pathway
is
determined
in
the
form
of
a
standard
luciferase
assay
.

Importantly
,
this
powerful
technique
preserves
the
structural
integrity
of
the
thymus
,
and
will
provide
an
invaluable
tool
to
study
how
thymocytes
respond
to
normal
environmental
stimuli
encountered
during
differentiation
within
the
thymic
milieu
.

Thus
,
this
method
allows
for
the
monitoring
of
signals
that
occur
in
a
biological
time
frame
,
such
as
during
differentiation
,
and
within
the
natural
environment
of
differentiating
cells
.

Core-binding
factor
beta
(
CBFbeta
)
,
but
not
CBFbeta-smooth
muscle
myosin
heavy
chain
,
rescues
definitive
hematopoiesis
in
CBFbeta
-deficient
embryonic
stem
cells
.

Core-binding
factor
beta
(
CBFbeta
)
is
the
non-DNA-binding
subunit
of
the
heterodimeric
CBFs
.

Genes
encoding
CBFbeta
(
CBFB
)
,
and
one
of
the
DNA-binding
CBFalpha
subunits
,
Runx1
(
also
known
as
CBFalpha2
,
AML1
,
and
PEBP2alphaB
)
,
are
required
for
normal
hematopoiesis
and
are
also
frequent
targets
of
chromosomal
translocations
in
acute
leukemias
in
humans
.

Homozygous
disruption
of
either
the
Runx1
or
Cbfb
gene
in
mice
results
in
embryonic
lethality
at
midgestation
due
to
hemorrhaging
in
the
central
nervous
system
,
and
severely
impairs
fetal
liver
hematopoiesis
.

Results
of
this
study
show
that
Cbfb-deficient
mouse
embryonic
stem
(
ES
)
cells
can
differentiate
into
primitive
erythroid
colonies
in
vitro
,
but
are
impaired
in
their
ability
to
produce
definitive
erythroid
and
myeloid
colonies
,
mimicking
the
in
vivo
defect
.

Definitive
hematopoiesis
is
restored
by
ectopic
expression
of
full-length
Cbfb
transgenes
,
as
well
as
by
a
transgene
encoding
only
the
heterodimerization
domain
of
CBFbeta
.

In
contrast
,
the
CBFbeta
-
smooth
muscle
myosin
heavy
chain
(
SMMHC
)
fusion
protein
generated
by
the
inv
(
16
)
associated
with
acute
myeloid
leukemias
(
M4Eo
)
can
not
rescue
definitive
hematopoiesis
by
Cbfb-deficient
ES
cells
.

Sequences
responsible
for
the
inability
of
CBFbeta
-SMMHC
to
rescue
definitive
hematopoiesis
reside
in
the
SMMHC
portion
of
the
fusion
protein
.

Results
also
show
that
the
CBFbeta-SMMHC
fusion
protein
transdominantly
inhibits
definitive
hematopoiesis
,
but
not
to
the
same
extent
as
homozygous
loss
of
Runx1
or
Cbfb
.

CBFbeta-SMMHC
preferentially
inhibits
the
differentiation
of
myeloid
lineage
cells
,
while
increasing
the
number
of
blastlike
cells
in
culture
.

The
latency
pattern
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
infection
and
viral
IL-10
expression
in
cutaneous
natural
killer/T-cell
lymphomas
.

The
nasal
type
,
extranodal
natural
killer
or
T
(
NK/T
)
-cell
lymphoma
is
usually
associated
with
latent
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
infection
.

In
order
to
elucidate
the
EBV
gene
expression
patterns
in
vivo
,
we
examined
eight
patients
with
cutaneous
EBV-related
NK/T-cell
lymphomas
,
including
six
patients
with
a
NK-cell
phenotype
and
two
patients
with
a
T-cell
phenotype
.

The
implication
of
EBV
in
the
skin
lesions
was
determined
by
the
presence
of
EBV-DNA
,
EBV-encoded
nuclear
RNA
(
EBER
)
and
a
clonality
of
EBV-DNA
fragments
containing
the
terminal
repeats
.

Transcripts
of
EBV-encoded
genes
were
screened
by
reverse
transcription-
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT-PCR
)
,
and
confirmed
by
Southern
blot
hybridization
.

The
expression
of
EBV-related
antigens
was
examined
by
immunostaining
using
paraffin-embedded
tissue
sections
and
cell
pellets
of
EBV-positive
cell
lines
.

Our
study
demonstrated
that
all
samples
from
the
patients
contained
EBV
nuclear
antigen
(
EBNA
)
-1
mRNA
which
was
transcribed
using
the
Q
promoter
,
whereas
both
the
Q
promoter
and
another
upstream
promoter
(
Cp/Wp
)
were
used
in
EBV-positive
cell
lines
,
B95.8
,
Raji
and
Jiyoye
.

Latent
membrane
protein-1
(
LMP-1
)
mRNA
was
detected
in
seven
of
eight
patients
and
all
cell
lines
,
whereas
EBNA-2
transcripts
were
found
only
in
the
cell
lines
.

Immunostaining
showed
no
LMP-1
,
EBNA-2
or
ZEBRA
antigens
in
the
paraffin-embedded
tissue
sections
,
although
they
were
positive
in
the
cell
line
cells
.

Latent
BHRF1
transcripts
encoding
bcl-2
homologue
and
BCRF1
transcripts
encoding
viral
interleukin
(
vIL
)
-10
were
detected
in
one
and
two
of
eight
patients
,
respectively
.

A
patient
with
NK-cell
lymphoma
expressing
both
transcripts
died
of
rapid
progression
of
the
illness
.

Our
results
indicate
that
the
restricted
expression
of
the
latency-associated
EBV
genes
and
the
production
of
vIL-10
and
bcl-2
homologue
may
favour
tumour
growth
,
evading
the
host
immune
surveillance

Oxidized
alkyl
phospholipids
are
specific
,
high
affinity
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
ligands
and
agonists
.

Synthetic
high
affinity
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
agonists
are
known
,
but
biologic
ligands
are
of
low
affinity
.

Oxidized
low
density
lipoprotein
(
oxLDL
)
is
inflammatory
and
signals
through
PPARs
.

We
showed
,
by
phospholipase
A
(
1
)
digestion
,
that
PPARgamma
agonists
in
oxLDL
arise
from
the
small
pool
of
alkyl
phosphatidylcholines
in
LDL
.

We
identified
an
abundant
oxidatively
fragmented
alkyl
phospholipid
in
oxLDL
,
hexadecyl
azelaoyl
phosphatidylcholine
(
azPC
)
,
as
a
high
affinity
ligand
and
agonist
for
PPARgamma
.

[

azPC
bound
recombinant
PPARgamma
with
an
affinity
(
K
(

)
(
(

)
)
approximately
40
nm
)
that
was
equivalent
to
rosiglitazone
(
BRL49653
)
,
and
competition
with
rosiglitazone
showed
that
binding
occurred
in
the
ligand-binding
pocket
.

azPC
induced
PPRE
reporter
gene
expression
,
as
did
rosiglitazone
,
with
a
half-maximal
effect
at
100
nm
.

Overexpression
of
PPARalpha
or
PPARgamma
revealed
that
azPC
was
a
specific
PPARgamma
agonist
.

The
scavenger
receptor
CD36
is
encoded
by
a
PPRE-responsive
gene
,
and
azPC
enhanced
expression
of
CD36
in
primary
human
monocytes
.

We
found
that
anti-CD36
inhibited
azPC
uptake
,
and
it
inhibited
PPRE
reporter
induction
.

Results
with
a
small
molecule
phospholipid
flippase
mimetic
suggest
azPC
acts
intracellularly
and
that
cellular
azPC
accumulation
was
efficient
.

Thus
,
certain
alkyl
phospholipid
oxidation
products
in
oxLDL
are
specific
,
high
affinity
extracellular
ligands
and
agonists
for
PPARgamma
that
induce
PPAR-responsive
genes

Regulation
of
the
human
MAT2B
gene
encoding
the
regulatory
beta
subunit
of
methionine
adenosyltransferase
,
MAT
II
.

Methionine
adenosyltransferase
(
MAT
)
catalyzes
the
biosynthesis
of
S-adenosylmethionine
(
AdoMet
)
,
a
key
molecule
in
transmethylation
reactions
and
polyamine
biosynthesis
.

The
MAT
II
isozyme
consists
of
a
catalytic
alpha2
and
a
regulatory
beta
subunit
.

Down-regulation
of
the
MAT
II
beta
subunit
expression
causes
a
6-10-fold
increase
in
intracellular
AdoMet
levels
.

To
understand
the
mechanism
by
which
the
beta
subunit
expression
is
regulated
,
we
cloned
the
MAT2B
gene
,
determined
its
organization
,
characterized
its
5'-flanking
sequences
,
and
elucidated
the
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
regulation
of
its
promoter
.

Transcription
of
the
MAT2B
gene
initiates
at
position
-203
relative
to
the
translation
start
site
.

Promoter
deletion
analysis
defined
a
minimal
promoter
between
positions
+52
and
+93
base
pairs
,
a
GC-rich
region
.

Inclusion
of
the
sequences
between
-4
and
+52
enhanced
promoter
activity
;
this
was
primarily
because
of
an
Sp1
recognition
site
at
+9/+15
.

The
inclusion
of
sequences
up
to
position
-115
provided
full
activity
;
this
was
attributed
to
a
TATA
at
-32
.

The
Sp1
site
at
position
+9
was
key
for
the
formation
of
protein.DNA
complexes
.

Mutation
of
both
the
Sp1
site
at
+9
and
the
TATA
at
-32
reduced
promoter
activity
to
its
minimal
level
.

Supershift
assays
showed
no
effect
of
the
anti-Sp1
antibody
on
complex
formation
,
whereas
the
anti-Sp3
antibody
had
a
strong
effect
on
protein.DNA
complex
formation
,
suggesting
that
Sp3
is
one
of
the
main
factors
binding
to
this
Sp1
site
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
assays
supported
the
involvement
of
both
Sp1
and
Sp3
in
complexes
formed
on
the
MAT2B
promoter
.

The
data
show
that
the
5'-untranslated
sequences
play
an
important
role
in
regulating
the
MAT2B
gene
and
identifies
the
Sp1
site
at
+9
as
a
potential
target
for
modulating
MAT2B
expression
,
a
process
that
can
have
a
major
effect
on
intracellular
AdoMet
levels
.

Molecular

regulation
of

.

Despite
vaccines
and
antiviral
substances
influenza
still
causes
significant
morbidity
and
mortality
world
wide
.

Better
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
influenza
virus
replication
,
pathogenesis
and
host
immune
responses
is
required
for
the
development
of
more
efficient
means
of
prevention
and
treatment
of
influenza
.

Influenza
A
virus
,
which
replicates
in
epithelial

and
leukocytes
,
regulates
host
cell
transcriptional
and
translational
systems
and
activates
,
as
well
as
downregulates
apoptotic

.

Influenza
A

results
in
the
production
of
chemotactic

,
pro-inflammatory

,
and

in

.

In
addition
of
upregulating
cytokine

,
influenza
A
virus
infection
activates

Comparison
of

N-Hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene
(
N-OH-AAF
)
is
the
proximate
carcinogenic
metabolite
of
the
powerful
rat
liver

2-acetylaminofluorene
.

In
this

to
examine
the

mutagenicity
and
DNA
adduct

by
N-OH-AAF
in

were
euthanized
up

.

Mutant

were
measured
in
the

,
and
lacI

were
determined
in
the

At

the

in

Also
at

,
5

,
and
9

N-

was
the
major

examined
.

Adduct

increased
with
total

to
maximum
values
in

and
remained
essentially

In

The
results

correlates
with
the

Expression
of
Mad1
in
T
cells
leads
to
reduced
thymic
cellularity
and
impaired
mitogen-induced
proliferation
.

To
investigate
Mad1
function
in
vivo
,
transgenic
mice
were
generated
that
express
a
Mad1
transgene
in
T
lineage
cells
under
the
control
of
the
proximal
lck
promoter
.

Thymus
size
in
lck-Mad1
transgenic
mice
is
drastically
reduced
although
representation
of
the
various
thymocyte
sub
populations
appears
normal
.

To
investigate
more
closely
any
effects
of
Mad1
expression
on
thymocytes
,
we
examined
thymic
selection
using
MHC
class
I-restricted
H-Y-TCR
transgenic
mice
.

Mad1
expression
in

reduces
the
efficiency
of
positive
selection
.

Furthermore
,
thymocytes
and
splenic
T
cells
from
lck-Mad1
transgenic
mice
display
a
profound
proliferative
defect
in
response
to
activation
with
either
PMA/Ionomycin
or
immobilized
anti-CD3/CD28
antibody
.

This
proliferative
defect
is
not
reversed
by
addition
of
exogenous
IL-2
and
is
p53-independent
.

The
growth

caused

Differential
requirement
for
the
transcription
factor
PU.1
in
the
generation
of
natural
killer
cells
versus
B
and
T
cells
.

PU.1
is
a
member
of
the
Ets
family
of
transcription
factors
required
for
the
development
of
various
lymphoid
and
myeloid
cell
lineages
,
but
its
role
in
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cell
development
is
not
known
.

The
study
shows
that
PU.1
is
expressed
in
NK
cells
and
that
,
on
cell
transfer
into
alymphoid
Rag2/gammac
(
-/-
)
mice
,
hematopoietic
progenitors
of
PU.1
(
-/-
)
fetal
liver
cells
could
generate
functional
NK
cells
but
not
B
or
T
cells
.

Nevertheless
,
the
numbers
of
bone
marrow
NK
cell
precursors
and
splenic
mature
NK
cells
were
reduced
compared
to
controls
.

Moreover
,
PU.1
(
-/-
)
NK
cells
displayed
reduced
expression
of
the
receptors
for
stem
cell
factor
and
interleukin
(
IL
)
-7
,
suggesting
a
nonredundant
role
for
PU.1
in
regulating
the
expression
of
these
cytokine
receptor
genes
during
NK
cell
development
.

PU.1
(
-/-
)
NK
cells
also
showed
defective
expression
of
inhibitory
and
activating
members
of
the
Ly49
family
and
failed
to
proliferate
in
response
to
IL-2
and
IL-12
.

Thus
,
despite
the
less
stringent
requirement
for
PU.1
in
NK
cell
development
compared
to
B
and
T
cells
,
PU.1
regulates

Epidemiologic
and
experimental
studies
suggest
that
diesel
exhaust
particles
(
DEPs
)
may
be
related
to
increasing
respiratory
mortality
and
morbidity
.

We
have
shown
that
DEPs
augmented
the
production
of
inflammatory
cytokines
by
human
airway
epithelial
cells
in
vitro
.

To
better
understand
the
mechanisms
of
their
proinflammatory
activities
,
we
studied
the
effects
of
several
components
extracted
from
DEPs
on
interleukin
(
IL
)
-8
expression
in
human
bronchial
epithelial
cell
line
BEAS-2B
and
normal
human
airway
epithelial
cells
obtained
from
very
peripheral
airways
by
an
ultrathin
bronchoscope
.

We
used
several
agents
active
on
signal

pathways
in
cytokine
expression
,
such
as
the
protein
kinase
C
inhibitor
staurosporin
,
antioxidant
agents
including
N-acetyl
cysteine
(
NAC
)
and
pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate
(
PDTC
)
,
and
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
inhibitor
SB203580
.

Benzene-extracted
components
showed
effects
mimicking
DEPs
on
IL-8
gene
expression
,
release
of
several
cytokines
(
IL-8
;
granulocyte

colony-stimulating

;
and

,
normal
T

expressed
and

)
and
nuclear

)
-kappa
B

.

We
also
found
that
NAC
,
PDTC
,
and
SB203580
suppressed
the
activities
of
DEPs
and
their
benzene
extracts
,
suggesting
the
roles
of
oxidants-mediated
NF-kappa
B
activation
and
p38MAPK
pathways
.

Finally
,
benzo
[

one

The
nuclear
receptor
PPAR
gamma
is
expressed
by
mouse
T
lymphocytes
and
PPAR
gamma
agonists
induce
apoptosis
.

Peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(
PPAR
)
-gamma
is
a
nuclear
hormone
receptor
that
serves
as
a
trans
factor
to
regulate
lipid
metabolism
.

Intense
interest
is
focused
on
PPAR-gamma
and
its
ligands
owing
to
its
putative
role
in
adipocyte
differentiation
.

Little
is
known
,
however
,
about
the
functions
of
PPAR-gamma
in
the
immune
system
,
especially
in
T
lymphocytes
.

We
demonstrate
that
both
naive
and
activated
ovalbumin-specific
T
cells
from
DO11.10-transgenic
mice
express
PPAR-gamma
mRNA
and
protein
.

In
order
to
determine
the
function
of
PPAR-gamma
,
T
cells
were
stimulated
with
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
and
ionomycin
or
antigen
and
antigen-presenting
cells
.

Simultaneous
exposure
to
PPAR-gamma
ligands
(
e.g.
15-deoxy-Delta
(
12
,
14
)
-prostaglandin
J
(
2
)
,
troglitazone
)
showed
drastic
inhibition
of
proliferation
and
significant
decreases
in
cell
viability
.

The
decrease
in
cell
viability
was
due
to
apoptosis
of
the
T
lymphocytes
,
and
occurred
only
when
cells
were
treated
with
PPAR-gamma
,
and
not
PPAR-alpha
agonists
,
revealing
specificity
of
this
response
for
PPAR-gamma
.

These
observations
suggest
that
PPAR-gamma
agonists
play
an
important
role
in
regulating
T
cell-mediated
immune
responses
by
inducing
apoptosis
.

T
cell
death
via
PPAR-gamma
ligation
may
act
as
a
potent
anti-inflammatory
signal
in
the
immune
system
,
and
ligands
could
possibly
be
used
to
control
disorders
in
which
excessive
inflammation
occurs
.

Suppression
of
lung
inflammation
in
rats
by
prevention
of
NF-kappaB
activation
in
the
liver
.

Activation
of
NF-kappaB
and
production
of
NF-kappaB
-dependent
chemokines
are
thought
to
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
neutrophilic
lung
inflammation
.

Calpain-1
inhibitor
(
CI-1
)
blocks
activation
of
NF-kappaB
by
preventing
proteolysis
of
the
inhibitory
protein
IkappaB-alpha
by
the
ubiquitin/proteasome
pathway
.

We
hypothesized
that
inhibition
of
proteasome
function
with
CI-1
would
block
NF-kappaB
activation
in
vivo
after
intraperitoneal
(
i.p.
)
treatment
with
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
,
and
that
NF-kappaB
inhibition
would
be
associated
with
suppression
of
chemokine
gene
expression
and
attenuation
of
neutrophilic
alveolitis
.

We
treated
rats
with
a
single
i.p.
injection
of
CI-1
(
10
mg/kg
)
two
hours
prior
to
i.p.
LPS
(
7
mg/kg
)
.

Treatment
with
Cl-1
prevented
degradation
of
IkappaB-alpha
and
activation
of
NF-kappaB
in
the
liver
in
response
to
LPS
;
however
,
Cl-1
treatment
had
no
detected
effect
on
NF-kappaB
activation
in
lung
tissue
.

CI-1
treatment
prior
to
LPS
resulted
in
40
%
lower
MIP-2
concentration
in
lung
lavage
fluid
compared
to
rats
treated
with
vehicle
prior
to
LPS
(
502
+/-
112
pg/ml
vs.
859
+/-144
pg/ml
,
P
<
0.05
)
.

In
addition
,
CI-1
treatment
substantially
inhibited
LPS-induced
neutrophilic
alveolitis
(
2.7+
/-
1.2
x
10
(

vs.
43.7
+/-
12.2
x
10
(

)
lung

neutrophils
,
P

)
.

These
data
indicate
that
NF-kappaB
inhibition
in
the
liver
can
alter
lung
inflammation
induced
by
systemic
LPS
treatment
and
suggest
that
a
liver-lung
interaction
contributes
to
the
inflammatory
response
of
the
lung
.

Notch1

CD8+
thymocytes
by
modulating

strength
.

Notch

decisions
in

.

We
demonstrate
in
this
report
that
retroviral

of
activated
Notch1
in
mouse
thymocytes
abrogates
differentiation
of
immature
CD4+CD8+
thymocytes
into
both
CD4
and
CD8
mature
single-positive
T

.

The
ability
of
Notch1
to
inhibit
T
cell
development
was
observed
in

and
in

with
both
normal
and
TCR

thymocytes
.

Notch1
-mediated
developmental
arrest
was
dose
dependent
and
was
associated
with
impaired
thymocyte
responses
to
TCR
stimulation
.

Notch1
also
inhibited
TCR-mediated

in
Jurkat
T

.

These
data
indicate
that
constitutively
active
Notch1
abrogates
CD4+
and
CD8+
maturation
by
interfering
with
TCR
signal
strength
and
provide
an
explanation
for

Expression
of
SART3
antigen
and
induction
of
CTLs
by
SART3-derived
peptides
in
breast
cancer
patients
.

We
recently
reported
the
SART3
tumour-rejection
antigen
as
possessing
tumour
epitopes
capable
of
inducing
HLA-class
I-restricted
cytotoxic
T

(
CTLs
)
.

This
study
investigated
expression
of
the
SART3
antigen
in
breast
cancer
to
explore
an
appropriate
molecule
for
use
in
specific
immunotherapy
of
breast
cancer
patients
.

The
SART3
antigen
was
detected
in
all
of
the
breast
cancer
cell
lines
tested
,
30
of
40
(
75
%
)
breast
cancer
tissue
samples
,
and
0
of
3
non-tumourous
breast
tissue
samples
.

SART3
derived
peptides
at
positions
109-118
and
315-323
induced
HLA-A24
restricted
CTLs
that
reacted
to
breast
cancer
cells
from
the
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMCs
)
of

.

Therefore
,
the
SART3
antigen
and
its
peptides
could
be
an
appropriate

for
use
in

of
the

Autostimulation
of
the
Epstein-Barr
virus
BRLF1
promoter
is
mediated
through
consensus
Sp1
and
Sp3
binding
sites
.

As
an
essential
step
in
the
lytic
cascade
,
the
Rta
homologues
of
gammaherpesviruses
all
activate
their
own
expression
.

Consistent
with
this
biologic
function
,
the
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
Rta
protein
powerfully
stimulates
the
promoter
of
its
own
gene
,
Rp
,
in
EBV-positive
B
cells
in
transient-transfection
reporter-based
assays
.

We
analyzed
the
activity
of
RpCAT
in
response
to
Rta
by
deletional
and
site-directed
mutagenesis
.

Two
cognate
Sp1
binding
sites
located
at
-279
and
-45
relative
to
the
transcriptional
start
site
proved
crucial
for
Rta-mediated
activation
.

Previously
described
binding
sites
for
the
cellular
transcription
factor
Zif268
and
the
viral
transactivator
ZEBRA
were
found
to
be
dispensable
for
activation
of
RpCAT
by
Rta
.

Gel
shift
analysis
,
using
extracts
of
B
cells
in
latency
or
induced
into
the
lytic
cycle
,
identified
Sp1
and
Sp3
as
the
predominant
cellular
proteins
bound
to
Rp
near
-45
.

During
the
lytic
cycle
,
ZEBRA
bound
Rp
near
the
Sp1/Sp3
site
.

The
binding
of
Sp1
and
Sp3
to
Rp
correlated
with
the
reporter
activities
in
the
mutagenesis
study
,
establishing
a
direct
link
between
transcriptional
activation
of
Rp
by
Rta
and
DNA
binding
by
Sp1
and/or
Sp3
.

The
relative
abundance
or
functional

of
the
cellular
Sp1
and
Sp3
transcription
factors
may
be
altered
in

to

that
induce

thereby
contribute
to

Gene

Solid

,
to
combat

,
by

.

Hypoxia

(
HIF-1
)

a
constitutively

basic
helix-loop-helix
transcription
factor
,
formed
by
the

(

,
that
is
stablized
in

.

It
activates
the
transcription

important
for

.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
engineered
down-regulation
of
HIF-1alpha
by
intratumoral
gene
transfer
of
an
antisense
HIF-1alpha
plasmid
leads
to
the
down-regulation

,
which
is

Mice
cured
of
their
tumors
by
combination
therapy
resisted
a
rechallenge
with
parental
tumor
cells
,
indicating
systemic
antitumor
immunity
had
been
achieved
.

In
summary
,
whilst
intensive
investigations
are
in
progress
to
target
the
many
HIF-1
effectors
,
the
results
herein
indicate
that
blocking
hypoxia-inducible
pathways
and
enhancing
NK-mediated
antitumor
immunity
by
targeting
HIF-1
itself
may
be
advantageous
,
especially
when
combined
with
cancer
immunotherapy
.

Runx2
:
a
novel
oncogenic
effector
revealed
by
in
vivo
complementation
and
retroviral
tagging
.

The
Runx2
(
Cbfa1
,
Pebp2alphaA
,
Aml3
)
gene
was
previously
identified
as
a
frequent
target
for
transcriptional
activation
by
proviral
insertion
in
T-cell
lymphomas
of
CD2-MYC
transgenic
mice
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
over-expression
of
the
full-length
,
most
highly
expressed
Runx2
isoform
in
the
thymus
perturbs
T-cell
development
,
leads
to
development
of
spontaneous
lymphomas
at
low
frequency
and
is
strongly
synergistic
with
Myc
.

To
gain
further
insight
into
the
relationship
of
Runx2
to
other
lymphomagenic
pathways
,
we
tested
the
effect
of
combining
the
CD2-Runx2
transgene
either
with
a
Pim1
transgene
(
E
(
mu
)
-Pim1
)
or
with
the
p53
null
genotype
,
as
each
of
these
displays
independent
synergy
with
Myc
.

In
both
cases
we
observed
synergistic
tumour
development
.

However
,
Runx2
appeared
to
have
a
dominant
effect
on
the
tumour
phenotype
in
each
case
,
with
most
tumours
conforming
to
the
CD3
(
+
)
,
CD8
(
+
)
,
CD4
(
+/-
)
phenotype
seen
in
CD2-Runx2
mice
.

Neonatal
infection
of
CD2-Runx2
mice
with
Moloney
murine
leukaemia
virus
(
Moloney
MLV
)
also
led
to
a
dramatic
acceleration
of
tumour
onset
.

Analysis
of
known
Moloney
MLV
target
genes
in
these
lymphomas
showed
a
high
frequency
of
rearrangement
at
c-Myc
or
N-Myc
(
82
%
)
,
and
a
significant
number
at
Pim1
or
Pim2
(
23
%
)
,
and
at
Pal1/Gfi1
(
18
%
)
.

These
results
indicate
that
Runx2
makes
a
distinct
contribution
to
T-cell
lymphoma
development
which
does
not
coincide
with
any
of
the
oncogene
complementation
groups
previously
identified
by
retroviral
tagging
.

The
involvement
of
TNF-alpha
-related
apoptosis-inducing
ligand
in
the
enhanced
cytotoxicity
of
IFN-beta
-stimulated
human
dendritic
cells
to
tumor
cells
.

TNF-alpha
-related
apoptosis-inducing
ligand
(
TRAIL
)
is
characterized
by
its
preferential
induction
of
apoptosis
of
tumor
cells
but
not
normal
cells
.

Dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
,
besides
their
role
as
APCs
,
now
have
been
demonstrated
to
exert
cytotoxicity
or
cytostasis
on
some
tumor
cells
.

Here
,
we
report
that
both
human
CD34
(
+
)
stem
cell
-derived
DCs
(
CD34DCs
)
and
human
CD14
(
+
)
monocyte
-derived
DCs
(
MoDCs
)
express
TRAIL
and
exhibit
cytotoxicity
to
some
types
of
tumor
cells
partially
through
TRAIL
.

Moderate
expression
of
TRAIL
appeared
on
CD34DCs
from
the
8th
day
of
culture
and
was
also
seen
on
freshly
isolated
monocytes
.

The
level
of
TRAIL
expression
remained
constant
until
DC
maturation
.

TRAIL
expression
on
immature
CD34DCs
or
MoDCs
was
greatly
up-regulated
after
IFN-beta
stimulation
.

Moreover
,
IFN-beta
could
strikingly
enhance
the
ability
of
CD34DCs
or
MoDCs
to
kill
TRAIL-sensitive
tumor
cells
,
but
LPS
did
not
have
such
an
effect
.

The
up-regulation
of
TRAIL
on
IFN-beta
-stimulated
DCs
partially
contributed
to
the
increased
cytotoxicity
of
DCS
:
Pretreatment
of
TRAIL-sensitive
tumor
cells
with
caspase-3
inhibitor
could
significantly
increase
their
resistance
to
the
cytotoxicity
of
IFN-beta
-stimulated
DCS
:
In
contrast
,
NF-kappaB
inhibitor
could
significantly
increase
the
sensitivity
of
tumor
cells
to
the
killing
by
nonstimulated
or
LPS-stimulated
DCS
:
Our
studies
demonstrate
that
IFN-beta
-stimulated
DCs
are
functionally
cytotoxic
.

Thus
,
an
innate
mechanism
of
DC-mediated
antitumor
immunity
might
exist
in
vivo
in
which
DCs
act
as
effectors
to
directly
kill
tumor
cells
partially
via
TRAIL
.

Subsequently
,
DCs
act
as
APCs
involved
in
the
uptake
,
processing
,
and
presentation
of
apoptotic
tumor
Ags
to
cross-prime
CD8
(

)
CTL
cells
.

Tumor
cells
regulate
the
lytic
activity
of
tumor-specific
cytotoxic
t
lymphocytes
by
modulating
the
inhibitory
natural
killer
receptor
function
.

Tumor-infiltrating
p58+
T
cells
from
a
renal
tumor
were
specifically
expanded
in
response
to
tumor
cell
stimulation
and
cloned
.

These
p58+
T
cells
were
found
to
express
a
memory
phenotype
and
corresponded
to
clonal
TCRBV3
T-cell
expansion
.

Functionally
,
p58
(
+
)
CTLs
displayed
a
low
lytic
activity
for
HLA-A2
tumor
and
normal
cells
.

However
,
this
lytic
activity
was
significantly
increased
after
blockade
of
p58
with
specific
monoclonal
antibodies
.

Interestingly
,
we
demonstrated
that
stimulation
by
tumor
cells
was
required
to
trigger
the
inhibitory
effect
of
p58
on
the
lytic
activity
of
antigen-specific
CTLs
and
that
stimulation
of
the
inhibitory
function
of
p58
by
tumor
cells
correlated
with
an
inhibition
of
nuclear
factor-kappaB
activation
in
p58+
tumor-specific
CTLS
.

Transcription
factors
are
essential
to
govern
differentiation
along
the
lymphoid
lineage
from
uncommitted
hematopoietic
stem
cells
.

Although
many
of
these
transcription
factors
have
putative
roles
based
on
murine
knockout
experiments
,
their
function
in
human
lymphoid
development
is
less
known
and
was
studied
further
.

Transcription
factor
expression
in
fresh
and
cultured
adult
human
bone
marrow
and
umbilical
cord
blood
progenitors
was
evaluated
.

We
found
that
fresh
CD34
(

)
Lin
(
-
)
cells
that
are
human
leukocyte
antigen
(
HLA
)
-DR
(
-
)
or
CD38
(
-
)
constitutively
express
GATA-3
but
not
T-cell
factor-1
(
TCF-1
)
or
Id-3
.

Culture
with
the
murine
fetal
liver
cell
line
AFT024
and
defined
cytokines
was
capable
of
inducing
TCF-1
mRNA
.

However
,
no
T-cell
receptor
gene
rearrangement
was
identified
in
cultured
progeny
.

Id-3
,
a
basic
helix
loop
helix
factor
with
dominant
negative
function
for
T-cell
differentiation
transcription
factors
,
also
was
upregulated
and
may
explain
unsuccessful
T-cell
maturation
.

To
better
understand
the
developmental
link
between
natural
killer
(
NK
)
cells
derived
from
progenitors
,
we
studied
NK
cell
subsets
circulating
in
blood
.

CD56
(

,
but
not
CD56
(
+dim
)
,
NK
cells
constitutively
express
TCF-1
by
reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
and
Western
blot
analysis
.

The
TCF-1
isoform
found
in
CD56
(
+bright
)
cells
,
which
express
lectin
but
not
immunoglobulin
class
I
recognizing
inhibitory
receptors
,
was
identical
to
that
induced
in
NK
cell
differentiation
culture
and
was
distinctly
different
from
isoforms
in
T
cells
.

These
results
suggest
that
TCF-1
does
not
target
human
killer
immunoglobulin
receptor
genes
,
TCF-1
is
uniquely
expressed
in
circulating
CD56
(
+bright
)
NK
cells
,
and
specific
TCF-1
isoforms
may
play
an
important
role
in
regulating
NK
differentiation
from
a
common
NK/T-cell
progenitor
.

Transcriptional
activation
by
a
matrix
associating
region-binding
protein
.

contextual
requirements
for
the
function
of
bright
.

Bright
(
B
cell
regulator
of
IgH
transcription
)
is
a
B
cell
-specific
,
matrix
associating
region-binding
protein
that
transactivates
gene
expression
from
the
IgH
intronic
enhancer
(
E
mu
)
.

We
show
here
that
Bright
has
multiple
contextual
requirements
to
function
as
a
transcriptional
activator
.

Bright
can
not
transactivate
via
out
of
context
,
concatenated
binding
sites
.

Transactivation
is
maximal
on
integrated
substrates
.

Two
of
the
three
previously
identified
binding
sites
in
E
mu
are
required
for
full
Bright
transactivation
.

The
Bright
DNA
binding
domain
defined
a
new
family
,
which
includes
SWI1
,
a
component
of
the
SWI.SNF
complex
shown
to
have
high
mobility
group-like
DNA
binding
characteristics
.

Similar
to
one
group
of
high
mobility
group
box
proteins
,
Bright
distorts
E
mu
binding
site
-containing
DNA
on
binding
,
supporting
the
concept
that
it
mediates
E
mu
remodeling
.

Transfection
studies
further
implicate
Bright
in
facilitating
spatially
separated
promoter-enhancer
interactions
in
both
transient
and
stable
assays
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
overexpression
of
Bright
leads
to
enhanced
DNase
I
sensitivity
of
the
endogenous
E
mu
matrix
associating
regions
.

These
data
further
suggest
that
Bright
may
contribute
to
increased
gene
expression
by
remodeling
the
immunoglobulin
locus
during
B
cell
development
.

Analysis
of
BCL-6
mutations
in
classic
Hodgkin
disease
of
the
B-
and
T-cell
type
.

BCL-6
is
essential
for
germinal
center
formation
and
thus
for
affinity
maturation
of
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
genes
by
somatic
mutations
.

The
5'-noncoding
region
of
the
BCL-6
gene
is
even
a
target
for
the
mutation
machinery
.

Translocations
of
the
BCL-6
gene
to
heterologous
promoters
and
mutations
of
its
5'-noncoding
regulatory
region
were
reported
to
be
potential
mechanisms
for
deregulating
BCL-6
expression
and
for
playing
a
role
in
the
genesis
of
non-Hodgkin
lymphoma
.

In
line
with
this
hypothesis
is
the
observation
that
B-cell
lymphoma
with
somatic
mutations
,
such
as
diffuse
large
B-cell
lymphoma
and
follicular
lymphoma
,
also
carry
BCL-6
mutations
,
some
of
which
are
recurrently
detectable
.

Classic
Hodgkin
disease
(
cHD
)
is
also
derived
from
B
cells
with
high
loads
of
somatic
mutations
and
thus
a
further
candidate
for
BCL-6
mutations
.

To
determine
the
presence
and
potential
role
of
BCL-6
mutations
in
cHD
,
the
5'-noncoding
BCL-6
proportion
of
single
Hodgkin
and
Reed-Sternberg
(
HRS
)
cells
from
6
cases
of
cHD
and
6
cases
of
HD-derived
cell
lines
was
analyzed
.

All
B-cell-derived
HD
cases
and
cell
lines
harbored
BCL-6
mutations
.

In
contrast
,
both
T-cell-derived
HD
cases
and
cell
lines
were
devoid
of
BCL-6
mutations
.

With
only
one
exception
,
there
were
no
lymphoma-specific
recurrent
BCL-6
mutations
detected
,
and
BCL-6
protein
was
absent
from
the
HRS
cells
of
most
cases
.

In
conclusion
,
(
1
)
somatic
BCL-6
mutations
are
restricted
to
cHD
cases
of
B-cell
origin
,
and
(
2
)
the
BCL-6
mutations
represent
mostly
irrelevant
somatic
base
substitutions
without
consequences
for
BCL-6
protein
expression
and
the
pathogenesis
of
cHD
.

Gadd45gamma
is
dispensable
for
normal
mouse
development
and
T-cell
proliferation
.

Gadd45gamma
,
a
family
member
of
the
growth
arrest
and
DNA
damage-inducible
gene
family
45
(
Gadd45
)
,
is
strongly
induced
by
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
in
peripheral
T
cells
.

While
in
most
tissues
all
Gadd45
family
members
are
expressed
,
Gadd45gamma
is
the
only
member
that
is
induced
by
IL-2
.

Here
we
show
that
the
IL-2
-induced
expression
of
Gadd45gamma
is
dependent
on
a
signaling
pathway
mediated
by
the
tyrosine
kinase
Jak3
and
the
transcription
factors
Stat5a
and
Stat5b
(
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
)
.

Previous
studies
with
ectopically
overexpressed
Gadd45gamma
in
various
cell
lines
implicated
its
function
in
negative
growth
control
.

To
analyze
the
physiological
role
of
Gadd45gamma
we
used
homologous
recombination
to
generate
mice
lacking
Gadd45gamma
.

Gadd45gamma
-deficient
mice
develop
normally
,
are
indistinguishable
from
their
littermates
,
and
are
fertile
.

Furthermore
,
hematopoiesis
in
mice
lacking
Gadd45gamma
is
not
impaired
and
Gadd45gamma
-deficient
T
lymphocytes
show
normal
responses
to
IL-2
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
Gadd45gamma
is
not
essential
for
normal
mouse
development
and
hematopoiesis
,
possibly
due
to
functional
redundancy
among
the
Gadd45
family
members
.

Gadd45gamma
is
also
dispensable
for
IL-2
-induced
T-cell
proliferation
.

Decreased
expression
of
c-myc
family
genes
in
thymuses
from
myasthenia
gravis
patients
.

The
thymus
is
a
critical
organ
for
the
elimination
of
autoreactive
T
cells
by
apoptosis
.

We
studied
the
expression
of
apoptosis-associated
genes
,
bcl-xL
,
bad
,
caspase-3
,
and
c-myc
family
genes
in
myasthenia
gravis
(
MG
)
thymuses
.

We
observed
that
the
mRNA
levels
of
myc
family
genes
,
c-myc
and
max
,
were
markedly
reduced
in
MG
thymuses
.

These
results
indicate
that
c-myc
-mediated
signaling
is
abnormal
in
MG
thymuses
.

molecules
whose
expressions
are

Immunohistochemical
detection
of
interferon-gamma-producing
cells
in
dermatophytosis
.

Skin
lesions
of
dermatophytosis
are
thought
to
be
a
result
of
a
T
cell
-dependent
inflammatory
response
that
is
mediated
by
various
cytokines
.

We
examined
whether
IFN-gamma-positive
cells
(
as
expression
of
Th1
response
)
were
present
in
the
skin
lesions
of
dermatophytosis
in
situ
by
immunohistochemical
techniques
.

Mixtures
of
CD4-positive
T
cells
and
CD8-positive
T
cells
were
found
to
be
present
in
the
dermal
infiltrates
of
the
lesions
.

Considerable
numbers
of
CD1a-positive
cells
were
detected
in
the
upper
dermis
and
epidermis
.

A
marked
accumulation
of
CD68-positive
cells
was
found
in
the
upper
dermis
.

IFN-gamma-positive
cells
were
present
in
the
upper
dermis
of
the
lesions
.

The
pattern
of
IFN-gamma
staining
appeared
to
be
intracellular
in
mononuclear
lymphoid
cells
.

The
staining
was
considered
to
be
highly
specific
because
it
could
be
completely
blocked
by
preabsorption
with
recombinant
IFN-gamma
.

Our
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
skin
lesions
of
dermatophytosis
may
be
associated
with
a
Th1
response
.

Th1
response
,
which
is
characterized
by
IFN-gamma
release
,
is
thought
to
be
involved
in
the
host
defense
against
dermatophytes
and
to
reflect
cutaneous
reaction
in
dermatophytosis
.

Regulation
of
the
helix-loop-helix
proteins
,
E2A
and
Id3
,
by
the
Ras
-
ERK
MAPK
cascade
.

Activation
of
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
pathways
leads
to
cellular
differentiation
and/or
proliferation
in
a
wide
variety
of
cell
types
,
including
developing
thymocytes
.

The
basic
helix-loop-helix
(
bHLH
)
proteins
E12
and
E47
and
an
inhibitor
HLH
protein
,
Id3
,
play
key
roles
in
thymocyte
differentiation
.

We
show
here
that
E2A
DNA
binding
is
lowered
in
primary
immature
thymocytes
consequent
to
T
cell
receptor
(
TCR
)
-mediated
ligation
.

Whereas
expression
of
E2A
mRNA
and
protein
are
unaltered
,
Id3
transcripts
are
rapidly
induced
upon
signaling
from
the
TCR
.

Activation
of
Id3
transcription
is
regulated
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
by
the
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
MAPK
module
.

These
observations
directly
connect
the
ERK
MAPK
cascade
and
HLH
proteins
in
a
linear
pathway
.

Retinoic
acid
up-regulates
myeloid
ICAM-3
expression
and
function
in
a
cell-specific
fashion
--
evidence
for
retinoid
signaling
pathways
in
the
mast
cell
lineage
.

Investigation
of
mast
cell
responsiveness
toward
retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
revealed
selective
promotion
of
ICAM-3
expression
in
the
human
mast
cell
line
HMC-1
.

This
process
was
dose-
and
time-dependent
and
detectable
by
flow
cytometry
,
Western
blot
analysis
,
ELISA
,
and
Northern
blot
analysis
.

ICAM-3
modulation
was
found
to
be
cell-type
dependent
,
detectable
also
for
HL-60
cells
and
monocytes
but
not
U-937
and
only
weakly
for
KU812
cells
.

Terminally
differentiated
skin
mast
cells
also
failed
to
up-modulate
their
ICAM-3
,
suggesting
the
requirement
for
some
degree
of
immaturity
for
the
process
.

RA-mediated
effects
on
ICAM-1
expression
,
studied
in
parallel
,
were
clearly
distinct
from
those
on
ICAM-3
.

Investigation
of
retinoid
receptor
expression
,
known
to
mediate
intracellular
RA
signaling
,
revealed
presence
of
RAR
alpha
,
RAR
gamma
,
RXR
beta
,
and
RXR
gamma
transcripts
in
all
cell
lines
studied
,
and
HMC-1
cells
were
the
only
line
lacking
RXR
alpha
.

RAR
beta
,
not
expressed
at
baseline
,
was
induced
by
RA
in
a
fashion
obviously
correlating
with
ICAM-3
up-regulation
.

Increased
ICAM-3
expression
was
of
functional
significance
,
such
that
processes
stimulated
or
co-stimulated
via
ICAM-3
(
homotypic
aggregation
,
IL-8
secretion
)
were
clearly
enhanced
upon
RA
pretreatment
,
suggesting
that
RA
may
contribute
via
hitherto
unrecognized
pathways
to
immune
function
and
host
defense
.

CD28
and
T
cell
co-stimulation
.

Over
the
last
decade
the
concept
of
T
cell
co-stimulation
has
emerged
to
take
a
central
role
in
the
process
of
T
cell
activation
.

However
,
the
exact
definition
of
co-stimulation
is
still
unclear
.

In
this
review
,
we
re-examine
the
concept
of
co-stimulation
.

We
suggest
that
while
co-stimulation
is
important
,
there
is
little
evidence
to
link
co-stimulation
with
T
cell
anergy
.

We
then
suggest
a
framework
for
studying
co-stimulation
.

Focusing
on
recent
advances
in
our
understanding
of
CD28
,
we
discuss
four
areas
of
T
cell
activation
where
co-stimulation
may
play
a
role
.

Regulation
of
activator
protein-1
and
NF-kappa
B
in
CD8+
T
cells
exposed
to
peripheral
self-antigens
.

The
transcriptional
events
that
control
T
cell
tolerance
to
peripheral
self
Ags
are
still
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
we
analyzed
the
regulation
of
AP-1
-
and
NF-kappa
B
-mediated
transcription
during
in
vivo
induction
of
tolerance
to
a
self
Ag
expressed
exclusively
on
hepatocytes
.

Naive
CD8
(
+
)
Desire
(
Des
)
(
+
)
T
cells
isolated
from
the
Des
TCR-transgenic
mice
that
are
specific
for
the
H-2K
(
b
)
class
I
Ag
were
transferred
into
Alb-K
(
b
)
-transgenic
mice
that
express
the
H-2K
(
b
)
Ag
on
hepatocytes
only
.

Tolerance
develops
in
these
mice
.

We
found
that
the
self-reactive
CD8
(
+
)
Des
(
+
)
T
cells
were
transiently
activated
,
then
became
unresponsive
and
were
further
deleted
.

In
contrast
to
CD8
(
+
)
Des
(
+
)
T
cells
activated
in
vivo
with
APCs
,
which
express
high
AP-1
and
high
NF-kappa
B
transcriptional
activity
,
the
unresponsive
CD8
(
+
)
Des
(
+
)
T
cells
expressed
no
AP-1
and
only
weak
NF-kappa
B
transcriptional
activity
.

The
differences
in
NF-kappa
B
transcriptional
activity
correlated
with
the
generation
of
distinct
NF-kappa
B
complexes
.

Indeed
,
in
vivo
primed
T
cells
predominantly
express
p50/p50
and
p65/p50
dimers
,
whereas
these
p50-containing
complexes
are
barely
detectable
in
tolerant
T
cells
that
express
p65-
and
c-Rel-containing
complexes
.

These
observations
suggest
that
fine
regulation
of
NF-kappa
B
complex
formation
may
determine
T
cell
fate
.

Transcriptional
regulation
in
lymphocytes
.

Lymphocytes
have
been
used
to
investigate
many
cellular
processes
,
including
lineage
commitment
,
differentiation
,
proliferation
and
apoptosis
.

The
transcription
factors
that
mediate
these
processes
are
often
expressed
broadly
in
many
cell
types
.

The
emerging
theme
is
one
of
cell-type-specific
regulation
,
affecting
not
only
the
functional
activation
of
transcription
factors
but
also
their
access
to
appropriate
regions
of
DNA
.

Existence
of
retinoic
acid-receptor
-independent
retinoid
X-receptor
-dependent
pathway
in
myeloid
cell
function
.

We
previously
reported
that
ER-27191
(

anthra
[

,

pyrrol-3-yl
]
benzoic
acid
)
is
a
potent
antagonist
of
retinoic
acid
receptor
(
RAR
)
,
and
ER-35795
(
(
2E
,
4E
,
6E
)
-7-
[
1-
(

,
3
,
4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl
]
-6-fluoro-3-methyl-2
,
4
,
6-nonatrienoic
acid
)
is
a
novel
retinoid
X
receptor
(
RXR
)
-specific
agonist
.

By
using
these
compounds
,
we
investigated
whether
distinct
RAR
-dependent
and
RXR
-dependent
pathways
operate
to
mediate
the
diverse
activities
of
retinoids
,
particularly
,
the
effects
of
the
RXR
pathway
on
cellular
function
.

ER-27191
completely
antagonized
HL60
cell
differentiation
induced
by
all-trans-retinoic
acid
(
atRA
)
.

However
,
the
differentiation
induced
by
the
ER-35795
was
not
antagonized
at
all
by
the
RAR
antagonist
,
but
was
inhibited
by
an
RXR
homodimer
antagonist
(
LGD100754
,
(
2E
,
4E
,
6Z
)
-7-
(
3-n-propoxy-5
,
6
,
7
,
8-tetrahydro-5
,
5
,
8
,
8-tetramethylnaphthalen-2-yl
)
-3-methylocta-2
,
4
,
6-trienoic
acid
)
.

Its
agonistic
action
on
RXR/RAR
heterodimer
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
neutralized
by
the
RAR
antagonist
.

During
HL60
cell
differentiation
,
atRA
induced
RARbeta
mRNA
,
while
the
RXR
had
no
effect
.

Interestingly
,
a
functional
RXR
-pathway
was
also
seen
in
lipopolysaccharide-induced
inhibition
of
mouse
splenocyte
proliferation
.

These
results
strongly
suggest
the
existence
of
a
pharmacological
RXR
-dependent
pathway
that
is
activated
by
a
ligand
that
can
bind
to
RXR
.

Targeting
Src
homology
2
domain-containing
tyrosine
phosphatase
(
SHP-1
)
into
lipid
rafts
inhibits
CD3
-induced
T
cell
activation
.

To
study
the
mechanism
by
which
protein
tyrosine
phosphatases
(
PTPs
)
regulate
CD3
-induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
,
we
investigated
the
distribution
of
PTPs
in
subdomains
of
plasma
membrane
.

We
report
here
that
the
bulk
PTP
activity
associated
with
T
cell
membrane
is
present
outside
the
lipid
rafts
,
as
determined
by
sucrose
density
gradient
sedimentation
.

In
Jurkat
T
cells
,
approximately
5
--
10
%
of
Src
homology
2
domain-containing
tyrosine
phosphatase
(
SHP-1
)
is
constitutively
associated
with
plasma
membrane
,
and
nearly
50
%
of
SHP-2
is
translocated
to
plasma
membrane
after
vanadate
treatment
.

Similar
to
transmembrane
PTP
,
CD45
,
the
membrane-associated
populations
of
SHP-1
and
SHP-2
are
essentially
excluded
from
lipid
rafts
,
where
other
signaling
molecules
such
as
Lck
,
linker
for
activation
of
T
cells
,
and
CD3
zeta
are
enriched
.

We
further
demonstrated
that
CD3
-induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
these
substrates
is
largely
restricted
to
lipid
rafts
,
unless
PTPs
are
inhibited
.

It
suggests
that
a
restricted
partition
of
PTPs
among
membrane
subdomains
may
regulate
protein
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
T
cell
membrane
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
targeted
SHP-1
into
lipid
rafts
by
using
the
N-terminal
region
of
Lck
(
residues
1
--
14
)
.

The
results
indicate
that
the
expression
of
Lck/SHP-1
chimera
inside
lipid
rafts
profoundly
inhibits
CD3
-induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
CD3
zeta/epsilon
,
IL-2
generation
,
and
nuclear
mobilization
of
NF-AT
.

Collectively
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
exclusion
of
PTPs
from
lipid
rafts
may
be
a
mechanism
that
potentiates
TCR
/
CD3
activation

An
instructive
component
in
T
helper
cell
type
2
(
Th2
)
development
mediated
by
GATA-3
.

Although
interleukin
(
IL
)
-12
and
IL-4
polarize
naive
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
toward
T
helper
cell
type
1
(
Th1
)
or
Th2
phenotypes
,
it
is
not
known
whether
cytokines
instruct
the
developmental
fate
in
uncommitted
progenitors
or
select
for
outgrowth
of
cells
that
have
stochastically
committed
to
a
particular
fate
.

To
distinguish
these
instructive
and
selective
models
,
we
used
surface
affinity
matrix
technology
to
isolate
committed
progenitors
based
on
cytokine
secretion
phenotype
and
developed
retroviral-based
tagging
approaches
to
directly
monitor
individual
progenitor
fate
decisions
at
the
clonal
and
population
levels
.

We
observe
IL-4
-dependent
redirection
of
phenotype
in
cells
that
have
already
committed
to
a
non-IL-4-producing
fate
,
inconsistent
with
predictions
of
the
selective
model
.

Further
,
retroviral
tagging
of
naive
progenitors
with
the
Th2-specific
transcription
factor
GATA-3
provided
direct
evidence
for
instructive
differentiation
,
and
no
evidence
for
the
selective
outgrowth
of
cells
committed
to
either
the
Th1
or
Th2
fate
.

These
data
would
seem
to
exclude
selection
as
an
exclusive
mechanism
in
Th1
/
Th2
differentiation
,
and
support
an
instructive
model
of
cytokine-driven
transcriptional
programming
of
cell
fate
decisions
.

In
vitro-activated
human
lupus
T
cells
express
normal
estrogen
receptor
proteins
which
bind
to
the
estrogen
response
element
.

We
have
shown
that
estrogen
receptor
(
ERalpha
,
ERbeta
)
transcripts
are
expressed
in
SLE
and
normal
T
cells
.

In
this
study
,
T
cell
nuclear
extracts
from
female
lupus
patients
and
normal
donors
were
tested
for
biologically
active
ER
proteins
capable
of
binding
to
the
human
estrogen
response
element
(
hERE
)
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
.

When
peripheral
blood
T
cells
were
stimulated
with
17beta-estradiol
(
E2
)
,
PMA
and
ionomycin
,
two
major
retarded
bands
in
T
cell
nuclear
extracts
exhibited
a
migration
pattern
similar
to
slow
migrating
protein-ERE
complexes
in
human
breast
cancer
cell
extracts
.

T
cells
cultured
only
with
E2
did
not
have
these
complexes
.

The
formation
of
the
complexes
was
inhibited
by
competition
with
the
hERE
cold
oligonucleotide
and
partially
with
anti-ERalpha
antibodies
.

There
was
no
notable
difference
in
the
migration
pattern
of
ERE-binding
proteins
between
the
SLE
and
normal
T
cell
extracts
.

Together
,
these
results
suggest
that
activated
human
T
cells
,
whether
lupus-derived
or
normal-derived
,
contain
biologically
active
ERalpha
proteins
.

Other
factors
may
be
responsible
for
differential
sensitivity
of
lupus
T
cells
to
estrogen
.

Mechanism
of
the
inhibitory
effect
of
protease
inhibitor
on
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
production
of
monocytes
.

If
the
inflammatory
response
becomes
excessive
or
uncontrolled
by
some
stimuli
,
inappropriate
inflammatory
responses
occur
.

Monocytes
are
extremely
important
cells
for
regulating
the
cytokine
network
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNFalpha
)
and
interleukin-
(
IL
)
10
,
which
are
mainly
synthesized
by
monocytes
,
are
representative
cytokines
that
play
a
central
role
in
the
cytokine
network
.

Protease
inhibitors
such
as
gabexate
mesilate
(
GM
)
and
ulinastatin
(
UTI
)
have
been
shown
to
have
various
beneficial
effects
by
inhibiting
the
activation
of
leukocytes
,
but
the
mechanism
for
this
has
yet
to
be
fully
elucidated
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
the
mechanism
of
the
inhibitory
effect
of
protease
inhibitors
on
the
proinflammatory
cytokine
production
of
lipopolysaccharide-
(
LPS
)
stimulated
monocytes
.

LPS-stimulated
monocytes
were
treated
with
GM
or
UTI
.

The
value
of
TNFalpha
and
IL-10
in
the
culture
medium
of
monocytes
was
measured
and
each
mRNA
expression
was
assayed
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
protease
inhibitors
on
the
activity
of
intracellular
signal
transduction
pathways
such
as
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
and
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
(
NFkappaB
)
were
also
evaluated
.

GM
decreased
the
TNFalpha
production
of
LPS-stimulated
monocytes
as
shown
by
the
inhibition
of
mRNA
expression
and
increased
the
IL-10
production
of
LPS-stimulated
monocytes
.

GM
also
suppressed
the
NFkappaB
activity
of
LPS-stimulated
monocytes
.

UTI
decreased
the
TNFalpha
production
of
LPS-stimulated
monocytes
,
but
did
not
inhibit
the
TNFalpha
mRNA
expression
.

The
present
study
shows
that
the
inhibitory
effect
of
GM
on
the
TNFalpha
production
of
activated
human
monocytes
is
mediated
by
the
suppression
of
NFkappaB
activation
,
while
the
mechanism
of
UTI
inhibiting
TNFalpha
production
of
human
monocytes
may
be
due
to
the
inhibition
of
either
the
translation
or
secretion
of
TNFalpha
.

Homocysteine
stimulates
the
expression
of
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
in
endothelial
cells
leading
to
enhanced
monocyte
chemotaxis
.

Hyperhomocysteinemia
has
been
identified
as
an
independent
risk
factor
for
atherosclerosis
.

The
infiltration
of
monocytes
into
the
arterial
wall
is
one
of
the
key
events
during
atherogenesis
.

Monocyte
chemoattractant
protein-1
(
MCP-1
)
is
a
potent
chemokine
that
stimulates
the
migration
of
monocytes
into
the
intima
of
the
arterial
wall
.

The
mechanism
by
which
increased
monocyte
infiltration
occurs
in
atherosclerotic
lesions
in
patients
with
hyperhomocysteinemia
has
not
been
delineated
.

The
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
investigate
the
effect
of
homocysteine
on
MCP-1
production
in
endothelial
cells
.

Cells
were
incubated
with
homocysteine
.

The
secretion
of
MCP-1
protein
was
significantly
increased
(
195
%
as
compared
to
the
control
)
in
cells
treated
with
pathological
concentrations
of
homocysteine
.

Such
effect
was
accompanied
by
an
increased
expression
of
MCP-1
mRNA
(
176
%
as
compared
to
the
control
)
in
endothelial
cells
which
resulted
in
enhanced
monocyte
chemotaxis
.

The
p38
MAP
kinase
as
well
as
other
members
of
the
p38
MAP
kinase
pathway
,
including
MKK3
,
MKK6
,
ATF-2
and
Elk-1
,
were
activated
in
homocysteine-treated
cells
.

Homocysteine-induced
MCP-1
expression
and
subsequent
monocyte
chemotaxis
were
blocked
by
a
p38
MAP
kinase
inhibitor
(
SB203580
)
suggesting
that
the
p38
MAP
kinase
pathway
might
be
involved
in
homocysteine-induced
MCP-1
expression
in
endothelial
cells
.

In
contrast
,
staurosporine
,
a
protein
kinase
C
inhibitor
,
had
no
effect
on
homocysteine-induced
MCP-1
expression
.

In
conclusion
,
our
results
indicate
that
homocysteine
stimulates
MCP-1
expression
in
endothelial
cells
leading
to
enhanced
monocyte
chemotaxis
.

Inducible
resistance
to
Fas-mediated
apoptosis
in
B
cells
.

Apoptosis
produced
in
B
cells
through
Fas
(
APO-1
,
CD95
)
triggering
is
regulated
by
signals
derived
from
other
surface
receptors
:
CD40
engagement
produces
upregulation
of
Fas
expression
and
marked
susceptibility
to
Fas
-induced
cell
death
,
whereas
antigen
receptor
engagement
,
or
IL-4R
engagement
,
inhibits
Fas
killing
and
in
so
doing
induces
a
state
of
Fas
-resistance
,
even
in
otherwise
sensitive
,
CD40
-stimulated
targets
.

Surface
immunoglobulin
and
IL-4R
utilize
at
least
partially
distinct
pathways
to
produce
Fas
-resistance
that
differentially
depend
on
PKC
and
STAT6
,
respectively
.

Further
,
surface
immunoglobulin
signaling
for
inducible
Fas
-resistance
bypasses
Btk
,
requires
NF-kappaB
,
and
entails
new
macromolecular
synthesis
.

Terminal
effectors
of
B
cell
Fas
-resistance
include
the
known
anti-apoptotic
gene
products
,
Bcl-xL
and
FLIP
,
and
a
novel
anti-apoptotic
gene
that
encodes
FAIM
(
Fas
Apoptosis
Inhibitory
Molecule
)
.

faim
was
identified
by
differential
display
and
exists
in
two
alternatively
spliced
forms
;
faim-S
is
broadly
expressed
,
but
faim-L
expression
is
tissue-specific
.

The
FAIM
sequence
is
highly
evolu-
tionarily
conserved
,
suggesting
an
important
role
for
this
molecule
throughout
phylogeny
.

Inducible
resistance
to
Fas
killing
is
hypothesized
to
protect
foreign
antigen-specific
B
cells
during
potentially
hazardous
interactions
with
FasL-bearing
T
cells
,
whereas
autoreactive
B
cells
fail
to
become
Fas
-resistant
and
are
deleted
via
Fas
-dependent
cytotoxicity
.

Inadvertent
or
aberrant
acquisition
of
Fas
-resistance
may
permit
autoreactive
B
cells
to
escape
Fas
deletion
,
and
malignant
lymphocytes
to
impede
anti-tumor
immunity
.

Stromal

alpha

chemotaxis
in
T

is
mediated
by
nitric
oxide
signaling
pathways
.

Stromal
cell-derived
factor
1
alpha
(
SDF1
alpha
)
and
its
cognate
chemokine
receptor
CXCR4
act
as
potent
chemoattractants
and
regulate
trafficking
and
homing
of
hematopoietic
progenitor
cells
and
lymphocytes
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
regulating
SDF1
alpha
-driven
cell
migration
are
not
well
defined
.

In
this
study
,
we
have
explored
the
roles
of
the
second
messenger
NO
and
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappa
B
in
SDF1
alpha
-induced
T
cell
migration
.

SDF1
alpha
treatment
of
Jurkat
T
cells
increased
the
activity
of
NO
synthase
,
which
catalyzes
the
generation
of
NO
.

We
observed
that
pretreatment
of
Jurkat
cells
or
activated
PBLs
with
several
NO
donors
significantly
enhanced
the
SDF1
alpha
-induced
migration
,
whereas
various
inhibitors
of
NO
synthase
markedly
abrogated
the
chemotactic
response
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner
.

Furthermore
,
we
observed
that
inhibitors
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappa
B
,
which
is
linked
to
NO
signaling
pathways
,
also
significantly
blocked
the
SDF1
alpha
-induced
chemotactic
response
.

However
,
these
compounds
did
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
SDF1
alpha
-induced
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
activity
.

In
addition
,
the
MAP/Erk
kinase
kinase
inhibitor
PD98059
did
not
abrogate
SDF1
alpha
-induced
chemotaxis
.

AKT
,
which
has
been
shown
to
mediate
NO
production
,
was
also
phosphorylated
upon
SDF1
alpha
stimulation
.

These
studies
suggest
that
NO-related
signaling
pathways
may
mediate
SDF1
alpha
-induced
chemotaxis
,
but
not
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
activation
.

The
lack
of
NF-kappa
B
transactivation
and
PKC
epsilon
expression
in
CD4
(
+
)
CD8
(
+
)
thymocytes
correlates
with
negative
selection
.

Deletion
of
autoreactive
thymocytes
at
the
DP
stage
is
the
basis
for
tolerance
to
thymus-expressed
self
antigens
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
whether
distinct
signalling
pathways
are
induced
in
DP
thymocytes
as
compared
to
mature
T
cells
upon
stimulation
with
antigen
.

Using
triple
transgenic
mice
expressing
a
TCR
transgene
,
dominant
negative
ras/Mek
proteins
and
a
reporter
gene
construct
with
AP-1
or
NF-kappa
B
binding
sites
,
we
showed
a
complete
lack
of
transcriptional
activity
of
NF-kappa
B
but
not
AP-1
in
DP
thymocytes
,
whereas
both
were
transcriptionally
active
in
mature
T
cells
after
antigenic
stimulation
.

Lack
of
NF-kappa
B
induction
correlated
with
increased
death
in
response
to
antigen
.

AP-1
induction
was
dependent
on
the
integrity
of
the
ras/Mek
pathway
indicating
that
this
pathway
was
activated
in
the
DP
thymocytes
.

In
contrast
,
we
found
a
complete
lack
of
constitutive
expression
of
the
epsilon
isoform
of
Protein
Kinase
C
(
PKC
)
in
DP
thymocytes
,
although
it
was
present
in
mature
thymocytes
and
peripheral
T
cells
.

Taken
together
the
results
suggest
that
the
lack
of
PKC
epsilon
in
DP
thymocytes
could
lead
to
the
absence
of
NF-kappa
B
activity
after
antigenic
stimulation
contributing
to
negative
selection
.

CD2
stimulation
leads
to
the
delayed
and
prolonged
activation
of
STAT1
in
T
cells
but
not
NK
cells
.

OBJECTIVE
:
T
lymphocytes
can
be
activated
by
soluble
factors
such
as
cytokines
or
through
direct
cell-cell
interactions
.

Although
cytokine
receptors
are
known
to
signal
through
STAT
family
transcription
factors
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
other
cell-surface
molecules
,
such
as
CD2
,
transduce
signals
is
unclear
.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
stimulation
of
T
cells
through
CD2
recapitulates
aspects
of
cytokine
-induced
T-cell
activation
by
use
of
STAT
transcription
factors
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
T
cells
were
treated
with
anti-CD2
antibodies
or
cells
bearing
the
natural
CD2
ligand
CD58
,
after
which
signaling
through
STAT
transcription
factors
was
assessed
.

RESULTS
:
Stimulation
of
CD2
on
primary
T
lymphocytes
leads
to
the
tyrosine
phosphorylation
,
nuclear
translocation
,
and
DNA
binding
of
STAT1
.

In
contrast
to
stimulation
by
cytokines
,
the
activation
of
STAT1
in
response
to
CD2
ligation
is
delayed
and
does
not
involve
Jak
kinases
.

Furthermore
,
while
STAT
phosphorylation
induced
by
cytokines
is
generally
transient
,
STAT1
phosphorylation
following
CD2
stimulation
persists
for
a
period
of
days
.

Transcription
of
key
target
genes
such
as
IRF1
and
c-fos
proceeds
with
delayed
kinetics
following
CD2
stimulation
,
suggesting
that
this
unique
pattern
of
STAT
activation
may
lead
to
a
distinct
cellular
response
following
CD2
ligation
.

This
pathway
appears
to
be
restricted
to
T
cells
,
as
stimulation
of
CD2
on
NK
cells
does
not
lead
to
STAT1
activation
.

CONCLUSION
:
Stimulation
of
T
cells
through
cell-surface
molecules
such
as
CD2
involves
activation
of
STAT
transcription
factors
,
thus
recapitulating
elements
of
cytokine
signaling
.

NFATc1
and
NFATc2
together
control
both
T
and
B
cell
activation
and
differentiation
.

NFAT
transcription
factors
play
critical
roles
in
gene
transcription
during
immune
responses
.

To
investigate
further
the
two
most
prominent
NFAT
family
members
,
NFATc1
and
NFATc2
,
we
generated
mice
bearing
lymphoid
systems
devoid
of
both
.

Doubly
deficient
T
cells
displayed
cell
surface
markers
of
activation
yet
were
significantly
deficient
in
the
development
of
multiple
effector
functions
,
including
Th
cytokine
production
,
surface
effector
molecule
expression
,
and
cytolytic
activity
.

Nevertheless
,
doubly
deficient
B
cells
were
hyperactivated
,
as
evidenced
by
extremely
elevated
serum
IgG1
and
IgE
,
as
well
as
plasma
cell
expansion
and
infiltration
of
end
organs
.

Thus
,
in
T
cells
,
NFATc1
and
NFATc2
are
dispensable
for
inflammatory
reactivity
but
are
required
for
effector
differentiation
,
while
in
B
cells
,
NFATs
regulate
both
normal
homeostasis
and
differentiation
.

Epstein-barr
virus
immediate-early
protein
BZLF1
is
SUMO-1
modified
and
disrupts
promyelocytic
leukemia
bodies
.

Although
the
immediate-early
proteins
of
both
herpes
simplex
virus
(
HSV
)
and
cytomegalovirus
(
CMV
)
are
known
to
modify
promyelocytic
leukemia
(
PML
)
(
ND10
)
bodies
in
the
nucleus
of
the
host
cell
,
it
has
been
unclear
whether
lytic
infection
with
gamma
herpesviruses
induces
a
similar
effect
.

The
PML
protein
is
induced
by
interferon
,
involved
in
major
histocompatibility
complex
class
I
presentation
,
and
necessary
for
certain
types
of
apoptosis
.

Therefore
,
it
is
likely
that
PML
bodies
function
in
an
antiviral
capacity
.

SUMO-1
modification
of
PML
is
known
to
be
required
for
the
formation
of
PML
bodies
.

To
examine
whether
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
lytic
replication
interferes
with
PML
bodies
,
we
expressed
the
EBV
immediate-early
genes
BZLF1
(
Z
)
and
BRLF1
(
R
)
in
EBV-positive
cell
lines
and
examined
PML
localization
.

Both
Z
and
R
expression
resulted
in
PML
dispersion
in
EBV-positive
cells
.

Z
but
not
R
expression
is
sufficient
to
disrupt
PML
bodies
in
EBV-negative
cell
lines
.

We
show
that
dispersion
of
PML
bodies
by
Z
requires
a
portion
of
the
transcriptional
activation
domain
of
Z
but
not
the
DNA-binding
function
.

As
was
previously
reported
for
the
HSV-1
ICP0
and
CMV
IE1
proteins
,
Z
reduces
the
amount
of
SUMO-1-modified
PML
.

We
also
found
that
Z
itself
is
SUMO-1
modified
(
through
amino
acid
12
)
and
that
Z
competes
with
PML
for
limiting
amounts
of
SUMO-1
.

These
results
suggest
that
disruption
of
PML
bodies
is
important
for
efficient
lytic
replication
of
EBV
.

Furthermore
,
Z
may
potentially
alter
the
function
of
a
variety
of
cellular
proteins
by
inhibiting
SUMO-1
modification

Suppression

To
elucidate
whether
troglitazone
exerts
an
antiinflammatory
effect
in
humans
,
in
vivo
,
we
investigated
the
suppression
of
nuclear

concentrations
were
also
measured
as

of

that
are

by
the

NFkappaB
.

Seven
nondiabetic
obese
patients
were
given
400
mg
troglitazone
daily
for
4
weeks
.

Blood
samples
were
collected
before
and
at
weekly
intervals
thereafter
.

MNC
were
separated

and
the
levels
of
intranuclear
NFkappaB
,
total
cellular
NFkappaB
,
IkappaBalpha
,
and
p47
(

subunit
and

were
determined
.

Plasma
was
used
to
measure
insulin
glucose
,
TNFalpha
,
sICAM
,
MCP-1
,
PAI-1
,
CRP
,
and
IL-10
.

Plasma
insulin
concentrations
fell
significantly
at
week
1
,
from
31.2
+/-
29.1
to
14.2
+/-
11.4
mU/L
(
P
<
0.01
)
and
remained
low
throughout
4
weeks
.

Plasma
glucose
concentrations
did
not
alter
significantly
.

There
was
a
fall
in
intranuclear
NFkappaB
,
total
cellular
NFkappaB
,
and
p47
(
phox
)
subunit
,
with
an
increase
in
cellular
IkappaBalpha
at
week
2
,
which
persisted
until
week
4
.

There
was
a
parallel
fall
in
ROS
generation
by
MNC
at
week
1
;
this
progressed
and
persisted
until
week
4
(
P

.

Plasma
TNF-alpha
,
sICAM-1

concentrations
fell
significantly
at
week
4
.

Plasma
IL-10
concentration
increased
significantly
,
whereas
plasma
CRP
concentrations
decreased
.

We
conclude
that
troglitazone
has
an
antiinflammatory
action
that
may
contribute
to
its
putative
antiatherosclerotic
effects

Although

little

that

.

The
involvement
of
the
tyrosine
kinases
p56
(
lck
)
and
ZAP-70
in
this
reaction
is
demonstrated
here
using
specific
pharmacological
inhibitors
and
Jurkat
mutants
unable
to
express
these
kinases
.

Although
the
inhibitors
prevented
both
pervanadate-induced
phosphorylation
of
I
kappa
B-alpha
on
Tyr42
and
NF-kappa
B
activation
,
we
observed
that
,
in
p56
(
lck
)
-deficient
Jurkat
mutants
,
NF-kappa
B
could
still
associate
with
I
kappa
B-alpha
despite
phosphorylation
on
Tyr42
.

Furthermore
,
the
SH2
domain
of
p56
(
lck
)
appeared
to
be
required
for
pervanadate-induced
NF-kappa
B
activation
but
not
for
Tyr42
phosphorylation
.

These
results
show
that
p56
(
lck
)
and
ZAP-70
are
key
components
of
the
signaling
pathway
that
leads
to
phosphotyrosine-dependent
NF-kappa
B
activation
in
T
cells
and
confirm
that
tyrosine
kinases
must
control
at
least
two
different
steps
to
induce
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
,
which
stimulates
p56
(
lck
)
and
ZAP-70
in
T
cells
,
is
an
activator
of
NF-kappa
B
through
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
I
kappa
B-alpha
.

Specific
missense
mutations
in
NEMO
result
in
hyper-IgM
syndrome
with
hypohydrotic
ectodermal
dysplasia
.

The
gene
that
encodes
nuclear
factor
kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
essential
modulator
(
or
NEMO
,
also
known
as
IKKgamma
)
is
required
for
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappaB
.

We
describe
mutations
in
the
putative
zinc-finger
domain
of
NEMO
that
result
in
an
X-linked
primary
immunodeficiency
characterized
by
hyper-IgM
syndrome
and
hypohydrotic
ectodermal
dysplasia
(
XHM-ED
)
.

These
mutations
prevent
CD40
ligand
(
CD40L
)
-mediated
degradation
of
inhibitor
of
NF-kappaB
alpha
(
IkappaB-alpha
)
and
account
for
the
following
observations
:
B
cells
from
XHM-ED
patients
are
unable
to
undergo
immunoglobulin
class-switch
recombination
and
antigen-presenting
cells
(
APCs
)
are
unable
to
synthesize
the
NF-kappaB-regulated
cytokines
interleukin
12
(
IL-12
)
or
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
when
stimulated
with
CD40L
.

Nevertheless
,
innate
immunity
is
preserved
in
XHM-ED
patients
because
APCs
retain
the
capacity
to
respond
to
stimulation
by
lipopolysaccharide
or
Staphylococcus
aureus
Cowan
's
antigen
(
SAC
)
.

Overall
,
the
phenotype
observed
in
XHM-ED
patients
shows
that
the
putative
zinc-finger
domain
of
NEMO
has
a
regulatory
function
and
demonstrates
the
definite
requirement
of
CD40
-mediated
NF-kappaB
activation
for
B
cell
immunoglobulin
class-switching
.

Granulocytic
differentiation
of
human
NB4
promyelocytic
leukemia
cells
induced
by
all-trans
retinoic
acid
metabolites
.

The
metabolism
of
all-trans
retinoic
acid
(
ATRA
)
has
been
reported
to
be
partly
responsible
for
the
in
vivo
resistance
to
ATRA
seen
in
the
treatment
of
human
acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
(
APL
)
.

However
,
ATRA
metabolism
appears
to
be
involved
in
the
growth
inhibition
of
several
cancer
cell
lines
in
vitro
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
evaluate
the
in
vitro
activity
of
the
principal
metabolites
of
ATRA
[
4-hydroxy-retinoic
acid
(
4-OH-RA
)
,
18-hydroxy-retinoic
acid
(
18-OH-RA
)
,
4-oxo-retinoic
acid
(
4-oxo-RA
)
,
and
5
,
6-epoxy-retinoic
acid
(

)
]
in
NB4
,
a
human
promyelocytic
leukemia
cell
line
that
exhibits
the
APL
diagnostic
t
(
15
;
17
)
chromosomal
translocation
and
expresses
the
PML-RAR
alpha
fusion
protein
.

We
established
that
the
four
ATRA
metabolites
were
indeed
formed
by
the
NB4
cells
in
vitro
.

NB4
cell
growth
was
inhibited
(
69-78
%
at
120
h
)
and
cell
cycle
progression
in
the
G1
phase
(
82-85
%
at
120
h
)
was
blocked
by
ATRA
and
all
of
the
metabolites
at
1
microM
concentration
.

ATRA
and
its
metabolites
could
induce
NB4
cells
differentiation
with
similar
activity
,
as
evaluated
by
cell
morphology
,
by
the
nitroblue
tetrazolium
reduction
test
(
82-88
%
at
120
h
)
or
by
the
expression
of
the
maturation
specific
cell
surface
marker
CD11c
.

In
addition
,
nuclear
body
reorganization
to
macropunctated
structures
,
as
well
as
the
degradation
of
PML-RAR
alpha
,
was
found
to
be
similar
for
ATRA
and
all
of
its
metabolites
.

Comparison
of
the
relative
potency
of
the
retinoids
using
the
nitroblue
tetrazolium
reduction
test
showed
effective
concentrations
required
to
differentiate
50
%
of
cells
in
72
h
as
follows
:
ATRA
,
15.8
+/-
1.7
nM
;
4-oxo-RA
,
38.3

The
ATRA
metabolites
were
found
to
exert
their
differentiation
effects
via
the
RAR
alpha
nuclear
receptors
,
because
the
RAR
alpha-specific
antagonist
BMS614
blocked
metabolite-induced
CD11c
expression
in
NB4
cells
.

These
data
demonstrate
that
the
principal
ATRA
Phase
1
metabolites
can
elicit
leukemia
cell
growth
inhibition
and
differentiation
in
vitro
through
the
RAR
alpha
signaling
pathway
,
and
they
suggest
that
these
metabolites
may
play
a
role
in
ATRA
antileukemic
activity
in
vivo
.

Expression
of
oestrogen
and
progesterone
receptors
by
mast
cells
alone
,
but
not
lymphocytes
,
macrophages
or
other
immune
cells
in
human
upper
airways
.

BACKGROUND
:
Nasal
polyposis
often
coexists
with
asthma
in
airway
inflammatory
conditions
characterised
by
the
infiltration
of
a
range
of
immune
cells
.

A
potentially
important
role
for
ovarian
hormones
has
been
implicated
in
airway
inflammation
but
the
cellular
target
for
such
action
is
not
known
.

METHODS
:
Expression
of
oestrogen
receptors
(
ER
)
and
progesterone
receptors
(
PR
)
was
examined
using
immunohistochemistry
in
formalin
fixed
nasal
polyp
tissues
from
47
subjects
.

The
cells
positive
for
ER
or
PR
were
confirmed
by
spatial
location
,
dual
immunolabelling
,
and
histochemical
staining
.

RESULTS
:
Consistent
with
the
known
features
of
nasal
polyps
,
CD4+
(
T
helper/inducer
)
,
CD8+
(
cytotoxic/suppressor
)
,
CD68+
(
macrophages
)
,
mast
cells
,
eosinophils
and
neutrophils
were
all
clearly
detected
by
their
relevant
monoclonal
antibodies
or
appropriate
histochemical
staining
,
but
only
mast
cells
tested
positive
for
ER
/PR
labelling
with
their
polyclonal
and
monoclonal
antibodies
.

The
frequencies
for
expression
were
61.7
%
for
ER
positive
and
59.6
%
for
PR
positive
cells
.

The
expression
of
ER
/
PR
was
independent
of
patient
sex
and
age
but
was
highly
correlated
with
the
numbers
of
mast
cells
(
r
=
0.973
,
p
<
0.001
for
ER
;
r
=
0.955
,
p
<
0.001
for
PR
)
.

Fewer
than
5
%
of
mast
cells
were
found
to
be
negative
for
ER
/
PR
expression
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
Mast
cells
alone
,
but
not
lymphocytes
,
macrophages
,
or
other
immune
cells
,
express
ER
/
PR
in
human
upper
airways
.

Numerous
ER/PR
positive
mast
cells
exist
in
nasal
polyps
,
indicating
that
this
may
be
a
major
route
for
the
involvement
of
sex
hormones
in
airway
inflammation
when
exposed
to
the
higher
and
varying
concentration
of
oestrogen
and
progesterone
characteristic
of
females
.

NF
kappa
b
signaling
in
posthypoxic
endothelial
cells
:
relevance
to
E-selectin
expression
and
neutrophil
adhesion
.

Our
previous
studies
have
implicated
the
nuclear
transcription
factor
kappa
B
(
NF
kappa
B
)
in
the
regulation
of
adhesion
molecule
expression
in
endothelial
cells
exposed
to
anoxia-reoxygenation
(
A/R
)
or
a
redox
imbalance
.

The
objectives
of
this
study
were
(
1
)
to
define
the
kinetics
of
NF
kappa
B
activation
by
examining
I
kappa
B
alpha
degradation
and
the
nuclear
translocation
of
p65
in
response
to
A/R
or
redox
imbalance
(
induced
by
treatment
of
cells
with
diamide
and
buthionine
sulfoximine
)
and
(
2
)
to
determine
whether
the
signal
for
I
kappa
B
alpha
degradation
,
nuclear
translocation
of
p65
,
and
E-selectin
-mediated
neutrophil
adhesion
is
related
to
the
activity
of
protein
tyrosine
kinase
(
PTK
)
,
protein
tyrosine
phosphatase
(
PTPase
)
and/or
protein
kinase
C
(
PKC
)
.

The
results
demonstrate
that
both
A/R
and
redox
imbalance
led
to
I
kappa
B
alpha
degradation
within
30
min
and
the
concomitant
appearance
of
p65
in
the
nucleus
,
consistent
with
rapid
cytosolic
activation
of
NF
kappa
B
and
subsequent
nuclear
translocation
of
the
activated
p65
subunit
.

Inhibition
of
PKC
blocked
I
kappa
B
alpha
degradation
and
p65
translocation
in
A/R-challenged
,
but
not
redox-altered
,
endothelial
cells
.

However
,
both
A/R-
and
redox-induced
NF
kappa
B
activation
was
blocked
by
inhibition
of
PTK
.

Similarly
,
A/R-induced
E-selectin
expression
and
neutrophil-endothelial
cell
adhesion
were
blocked
by
inhibition
of
PKC
or
PTK
,
while
only
PTK
inhibited
the
redox-induced
adhesion
response
.

Pretreatment
of
cells
with
N-acetyl
cysteine
effectively
blocked
A/R-
or
redox-induced
I
kappa
B
degradation
and
significantly
attenuated
the
respective
neutrophil
adhesion
responses
.

Collectively
,
these
findings
indicate
that
A/R-induced
E-selectin
expression
and
neutrophil-endothelial
cell
adhesion
are
mediated
by
both
PKC
and
PTK
,
which
signal
rapid
activation
of
NF
kappa
B
.

This
A/R-induced
NF
kappa
B
signaling
response
appears
to
be
mediated
,
at
least
in
part
,
by
intracellular
redox
imbalance
.

Induction
of
apoptosis
in
human
lymphocytes
by
the
herbicide
2
,
4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid
.

Dimethylammonium
salt
of
2
,
4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
acid
(
DMA-2
,
4-D
)
is
a
widely
used
herbicide
that
is
considered
moderately
toxic
.

In
the
present
study
we
found
that
DMA-2
,
4-D
is
able
to
cause
apoptosis
in
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
of
healthy
individuals
and
Jurkat
T
cells
.

Apoptosis
induced
by
DMA-2
,
4-D
was
dose
and
time
dependent
,
independent
of
Fas
,
TNF
receptor
1
or
the
aromatic
hydrocarbon
receptor
,
and
involved
disruption
of
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
and
activation
of
caspase-9
.

ZVAD-FMK
,
a
broad-spectrum
inhibitor
of
caspases
,
blocked
DMA-2
,
4-D-induced
apoptosis
completely
.

While
an
inhibitor
of
caspase-9
,
as
well
as
caspase-9
and
caspase-3
inhibitors
in
combination
,
strongly
blocked
DMA-2
,
4-D-induced
apoptosis
,
an
inhibitor
of
caspase-3
had
a
moderate
inhibitory
effect
.

Unlike
Fas
-mediated
apoptosis
,
the
initiator
caspase
,
caspase-8
,
was
not
involved
in
DMA-2
,
4-D-induced
apoptosis
.

Transfection
of
Jurkat
cells
with
Bcl-2
prevented
DMA-2
,
4-D-induced
disruption
of
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
and
led
to
a
complete
blockage
of
apoptosis
.

Our
data
indicate
that
DMA-2
,
4-D
kills
human
lymphocytes
by
initiating
apoptosis
via
a
direct
effect
on
mitochondria
.

The
activation
of
caspases
occurs
downstream
of
mitochondrial
damage
,
and
the
dysfunction
of
mitochondria
appears
to
be
sufficient
for
triggering
all
downstream
events
leading
to
apoptosis
.

Inhibition
of
Th1
differentiation
by
IL-6
is
mediated
by
SOCS1
.

Interleukin
6
(
IL-6
)
is
a
cytokine
produced
by
immune
and
nonimmune
cells
and
exhibits
functional
pleiotropy
and
redundancy
.

IL-6
plays
an
important
role
in
the
differentiation
of
several
cell
types
.

Here
,
we
describe
a
novel
function
of
IL-6
:
the
negative
regulation
of
CD4
+
Th1
cell
differentiation
.

While
IL-6
-directed
CD4
+
Th2
differentiation
is
mediated
by
IL-4
,
inhibition
of
Th1
differentiation
by
IL-6
is
independent
of
IL-4
.

IL-6
upregulates
suppressor
of
cytokine
signaling
1
(
SOCS1
)
expression
in
activated
CD4+
T
cells
,
thereby
interfering
with
signal
transducer
and
activator
of
transcription
1
(
STAT1
)
phosphorylation
induced
by
interferon
gamma
(
IFNgamma
)
.

Inhibition
of
IFNgamma
receptor-mediated
signals
by
IL-6
prevents
autoregulation
of
IFNgamma
gene
expression
by
IFNgamma
during
CD4+
T
cell
activation
,
thereby
preventing
Th1
differentiation
.

Thus
,
IL-6
promotes
CD4
+
Th2
differentiation
and
inhibits
Th1
differentiation
by
two
independent
molecular
mechanisms
.

Interaction
between
CCAAT/enhancer
binding
protein
and
cyclic
AMP
response
element
binding
protein
1
regulates
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
transcription
in
cells
of
the
monocyte/macrophage
lineage
.

Recent
observations
have
shown
two
CCAAT/enhancer
binding
protein
(
C/EBP
)
binding
sites
to
be
critically
important
for
efficient
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
replication
within
cells
of
the
monocyte/macrophage
lineage
,
a
cell
type
likely
involved
in
transport
of
the
virus
to
the
brain
.

Additionally
,
sequence
variation
at
C/EBP
site
I
,
which
lies
immediately
upstream
of
the
distal
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
site
and
immediately
downstream
of
a
binding
site
for
activating
transcription
factor
(
ATF
)
/
cyclic
AMP
response
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
,
has
been
shown
to
affect
HIV-1
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
activity
.

Given
that
C/EBP
proteins
have
been
shown
to
interact
with
many
other
transcription
factors
including
members
of
the
ATF/CREB
family
,
we
proceeded
to
determine
whether
an
adjacent
ATF/CREB
binding
site
could
affect
C/EBP
protein
binding
to
C/EBP
site
I
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
analyses
indicated
that
selected
ATF/CREB
site
variants
assisted
in
the
recruitment
of
C/EBP
proteins
to
an
adjacent
,
naturally
occurring
,
low-affinity
C/EBP
site
.

This
biophysical
interaction
appears
to
occur
via
at
least
two
mechanisms
.

First
,
low
amounts
of
CREB-1
and
C/EBP
appear
to
heterodimerize
and
bind
to
a
site
consisting
of
a
half
site
from
both
the
ATF/CREB
and
C/EBP
binding
sites
.

In
addition
,
CREB-1
homodimers
bind
to
the
ATF/CREB
site
and
recruit
C/EBP
dimers
to
their
cognate
weak
binding
sites
.

This
interaction
is
reciprocal
,
since
C/EBP
dimer
binding
to
a
strong
C/EBP
site
leads
to
enhanced
CREB-1
recruitment
to
ATF/CREB
sites
that
are
weakly
bound
by
CREB
.

Sequence
variation
at
both
C/EBP
and
ATF/CREB
sites
affects
the
molecular
interactions
involved
in
mediating
both
of
these
mechanisms
.

Most
importantly
,
sequence
variation
at
the
ATF/CREB
binding
site
affected
basal
LTR
activity
as
well
as
LTR
function
following
interleukin-6
stimulation
,
a
treatment
that
leads
to
increases
in
C/EBP
activation
.

Thus
,
HIV-1
LTR
ATF/CREB
binding
site
sequence
variation
may
modulate
cellular
signaling
at
the
viral
promoter
through
the
C/EBP
pathway

Selective
inhibition
of
interleukin-4
gene
expression
in
human
T
cells
by
aspirin
.

Previous
studies
indicated
that
aspirin
(
acetylsalicylic
acid
[
ASA
]
)
can
have
profound
immunomodulatory
effects
by
regulating
cytokine
gene
expression
in
several
types
of
cells
.

This
study
is
the
first
in
which
concentrations
of
ASA
in
the
therapeutic
range
were
found
to
significantly
reduce
interleukin
(
IL
)
-4
secretion
and
RNA
expression
in
freshly
isolated
and
mitogen-primed
human
CD4+
T
cells
.

In
contrast
,
ASA
did
not
affect
IL-13
,
interferon-gamma
,
and
IL-2
expression
.

ASA
inhibited
IL-4
,
but
not
IL-2
,
promoter-driven
chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
expression
in
transiently
transfected
Jurkat
T
cells
.

The
structurally
unrelated
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
indomethacin
and
flurbiprofen
did
not
affect
cytokine
gene
expression
in
T
cells
,
whereas
the
weak
cyclo-oxygenase
inhibitor
salicylic
acid
was
at
least
as
effective
as
ASA
in
inhibiting
IL-4
expression
and
promoter
activity
.

The
inhibitory
effect
of
ASA
on
IL-4
transcription
was
not
mediated
by
decreased
nuclear
expression
of
the
known
salicylate
target
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappaB
and
was
accompanied
by
reduced
binding
of
an
inducible
factor
to
an
IL-4
promoter
region
upstream
of
,
but
not
overlapping
,
the
NF
of
activated
T
cells-
and
NF-kappaB-binding
P1
element
.

It
is
concluded
that
anti-inflammatory
salicylates
,
by
means
of
a
previously
unrecognized
mechanism
of
action
,
can
influence
the
nature
of
adaptive
immune
responses
by
selectively
inhibiting
the
expression
of
IL-4
,
a
critical
effector
of
these
responses
,
in
CD4+
T
cells
.

Molecular
and
cellular
mediators
of
interleukin-1
-dependent
acute
inflammatory
arthritis
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
examine
the
molecular
and
cellular
mechanisms
in
a
model
of
acute
inflammatory
monarticular
arthritis
induced
by
methylated
bovine
serum
albumin
(
mBSA
)
and
interleukin-1
(
IL-1
)
.

METHODS
:
Mice
were
injected
intraarticularly
with
mBSA
on
day
0
and
subcutaneously
with
recombinant
human
IL-1beta
on
days
0-2
.

At
day
7
,
knee
joints
were
removed
and
assessed
histologically
.

Flow
cytometry
and
RNase
protection
were
used
to
analyze
IL-1
-dependent
events
.

RESULTS
:
C57BL/6
(
B6
)
,
129/Sv
,
and
(
B6
x
129/
Sv
)
F1
hybrid
mice
,
all
H-2b
strains
,
were
susceptible
to
mBSA
/IL-1-induced
arthritis
,
whereas
C3H/HeJ
(
H-2k
)
mice
were
not
.

B6
mice
lacking
T
and
B
cells
(
RAG1-/-
)
or
major
histocompatibility
complex
(
MHC
)
class
II
antigens
(
MHCII-/-
)
,
and
B6
mice
treated
with
a
CD4+
T
cell-depleting
monoclonal
antibody
,
were
resistant
to
disease
.

In
contrast
,
B
cell-deficient
(
muMT/
muMT
)
mice
developed
arthritis
at
an
incidence
and
severity
similar
to
that
of
controls
.

RelB-deficient
(
RelB-/-
)
bone
marrow
chimeric
mice
had
arthritis
that
was
significantly
reduced
in
incidence
and
severity
.

In
B6
mice
,
flow
cytometry
demonstrated
an
IL-1-dependent
leukocyte
infiltration
into
the
synovial
compartment
and
RNase
protection
assays
revealed
induction
of
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
for
the
chemokines
monocyte
chemoattractant
protein
1
,
macrophage
inhibitory
protein
2
(
MIP-2
)
,
RANTES
,
MIP-1alpha
,
and
MIP-1beta
,
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.

CONCLUSION
:
Arthritis
induced
by
mBSA
/
IL-1
is
strain
specific
and
dependent
on
CD4+
T
lymphocytes
and
at
least
partially
on
RelB
,
but
not
on
B
lymphocytes
or
antibody
.

IL-1
contributes
to
leukocyte
recruitment
to
the
synovium
and
directly
induces
chemokine
mRNA
production
by
synovial
cells
.

This
model
of
acute
monarticular
arthritis
is
particularly
suitable
for
further
investigations
into
cell-mediated
immunity
in
arthritis
and
the
role
of
IL-1
.

Positive
and
negative
regulation
of
granulopoiesis
by
endogenous
RARalpha
.

Acute
promyelocytic
leukemia
(
APL
)
is
always
associated
with
chromosomal
translocations
that
disrupt
the
retinoic
acid
receptor
alpha
(
RARalpha
)
gene
.

Whether
these
translocations
relate
to
a
role
for
endogenous
RARalpha
in
normal
granulopoiesis
remains
uncertain
because
most
studies
addressing
this
question
have
used
non-physiological
overexpression
systems
.

Granulocyte
differentiation
in
cells
derived
from
RARalpha-deficient
(
RARalpha
(
-/-
)
)
mice
was
studied
and
evaluated
in
the
context
of
agonist-bound
and
ligand-free
RARalpha
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
RARalpha
is
dispensable
for
granulopoiesis
,
as
RARalpha
(
-/-
)
mice
have
a
normal
granulocyte
population
despite
an
impaired
ability
to
respond
to
retinoids
.

However
,
although
it
is
not
absolutely
required
,
RARalpha
can
bidirectionally
modulate
granulopoiesis
.

RARalpha
stimulates
differentiation
in
response
to
exogenous
retinoic
acid
.

Furthermore
,
endogenous
retinoids
control
granulopoiesis
in
vivo
,
as
either
vitamin
A-deficient
mice
or
animals
treated
with
an
RAR
antagonist
accumulate
more
immature
granulocytes
in
their
bone
marrow
.

Conversely
,
RARalpha
acts
to
limit
differentiation
in
the
absence
of
ligand
because
granulocyte
precursors
from
RARalpha
(
-/-
)
mice
differentiate
earlier
in
culture
.

Thus
,
the
block
in
granulopoiesis
exerted
by
RARalpha
fusion
proteins
expressed
in
APL
cells
may
correspond
to
an
amplification
of
a
normal
function
of
unliganded
RARalpha
.

Expression
and
function
of
a
stem
cell
promoter
for
the
murine
CBFalpha2
gene
:
distinct
roles
and
regulation
in
natural
killer
and
T
cell
development
.

The
Runt
family
transcription
factor
CBFalpha2
(
AML1
,
PEBP2alphaB
,
or
Runx1
)
is
required
by
hematopoietic
stem
cells
and
expressed
at
high
levels
in
T-lineage
cells
.

In
human
T
cells
CBFalpha2
is
usually
transcribed
from
a
different
promoter
(
distal
promoter
)
than
in
myeloid
cells
(
proximal
promoter
)
,
but
the
developmental
and
functional
significance
of
this
promoter
switch
has
not
been
known
.

Here
,
we
report
that
both
coding
and
noncoding
sequences
of
the
distal
5
'
end
are
highly
conserved
between
the
human
and
the
murine
genes
,
and
the
distal
promoter
is
responsible
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
CBFalpha2
expression
in
murine
hematopoietic
stem
cells
as
well
as
in
T
cells
.

Distal
promoter
activity
is
maintained
throughout
T
cell
development
and
at
lower
levels
in
B
cell
development
,
but
downregulated
in
natural
killer
cell
development
.

The
distal
N-terminal
isoform
binds
to
functionally
important
regulatory
sites
from
known
target
genes
with
two-
to
threefold
higher
affinity
than
the
proximal
N-terminal
isoform
.

Neither
full-length
isoform
alters
growth
of
a
myeloid
cell
line
under
nondifferentiating
conditions
,
but
the
proximal
isoform
selectively
delays
mitotic
arrest
of
the
cell
line
under
differentiating
conditions
,
resulting
in
the
generation
of
greater
numbers
of
neutrophils
.

Constitutive
PI3-K
activity
is
essential
for
proliferation
,
but
not
survival
,
of
Theileria
parva-transformed
B
cells
.

Theileria
is
an
intracellular
parasite
that
causes
lymphoproliferative
disorders
in
cattle
,
and
infection
of
leucocytes
induces
a
transformed
phenotype
similar
to
tumour
cells
,
but
the
mechanisms
by
which
the
parasite
induces
this
phenotype
are
not
understood
.

Here
,
we
show
that
infected
B
lymphocytes
display
constitutive
phosphoinositide
3-kinase
(
PI3-K
)
activity
,
which
appears
to
be
necessary
for
proliferation
,
but
not
survival
.

Importantly
,
we
demonstrate
that
one
mechanism
by
which
PI3-K
mediates
the
proliferation
of
infected
B
lymphocytes
is
through
the
induction
of
a
granulocyte-monocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
-dependent
autocrine
loop
.

PI3-K
induction
of
GM-CSF
appears
to
be
at
the
transcriptional
level
and
,
consistently
,
we
demonstrate
that
PI3-K
is
also
involved
in
the
constitutive
induction
of
AP-1
and
NF-kappaB
,
which
characterizes
Theileria-infected
leucocytes
.

Taken
together
,
our
results
highlight
a
novel
strategy
exploited
by
the
intracellular
parasite
Theileria
to
induce
continued
proliferation
of
its
host
leucocyte
.

Lymphokine
dependence
of
STAT3
activation
produced
by
surface
immunoglobulin
cross-linking
and
by
phorbol
ester
plus
calcium
ionophore
treatment
in
B
cells
.

Stimulation
of
B
cells
by
surface
immunoglobulin
(
sIg
)
triggering
,
or
through
the
mitogenic
combination
of
phorbol
ester
and
calcium
ionophore
,
is
accompanied
by
activation
of
STAT
transcription
factors
.

The
mechanism
responsible
for
the
delayed
nuclear
accumulation
of
phosphorylated
STAT3
was
examined
in
detail
,
focusing
on
the
role
of
B
cell-derived
lymphokines
.

sIg
-induced
activation
of
STAT3
was
partially
inhibited
in
B
cells
obtained
from
IL-6-
or
IL-10-deficient
mice
,
and
was
partially
blocked
by
neutralizing
antibodies
directed
against
either
of
these
lymphokines
.

sIg
-induced
STAT3
activation
was
completely
inhibited
by
combining
IL-6-
and
IL-10-specific
neutralizing
antibodies
,
or
by
adding
individual
neutralizing
antibodies
to
B
cells
obtained
from
lymphokine-deficient
animals
.

In
contrast
,
IL-10
alone
appeared
to
account
for
STAT3
activation
resulting
from
B
cell
stimulation
with
phorbol
ester
and
calcium
ionophore
.

In
keeping
with
these
results
,
soluble
IL-6
and
IL-10
were
found
in
supernatant
fluid
obtained
from
stimulated
B
cells
.

This
work
indicates
that
a
lymphokine
pathway
is
responsible
for
STAT3
activation
that
occurs
late
after
B
cell
stimulation
,
and
points
out
differences
in
B
cell
activation
that
result
from
stimulation
through
the
antigen
receptor
and
through
pharmacological
mimicry
of
signaling
mediators
.

Transcription
factor
AP-4
is
a
ligand
for
immunoglobulin-kappa
promoter
E-box
elements
.

Immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
-kappa
promoters
from
humans
and
mice
share
conserved
sequences
.

The
octamer
element
is
common
to
all
Ig
promoters
and
pivotal
for
their
function
.

However
,
other
conserved
sequence
motifs
,
that
differ
between
Ig
variable
gene
families
,
are
required
for
normal
promoter
function
.

These
conserved
motifs
do
not
stimulate
transcription
in
the
absence
of
an
octamer
.

One
example
is
an
E-box
of
the
E47/E12
type
(
5'-CAGCTG-3
'
)
,
which
is
found
in
all
promoters
of
the
human
and
murine
Ig-kappa
gene
subgroups/families
,
with
the
exception
of
subgroups
II
and
VI
and
their
related
murine
families
.

In
the
present
study
we
show
that
the
ubiquitously
expressed
transcription
factor
AP-4
,
and
not
E47
,
interacts
specifically
with
the
kappa
promoter
E-boxes
when
tested
in
electrophoretic
mobility-shift
assays
using
nuclear
extracts
derived
from
human
and
murine
B-cell
lines
.

Furthermore
,
AP-4
,
unlike
E47
,
did
not
act
as
a
transactivator
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
previous
studies
on
intact
kappa
promoters
,
showing
that
transcription
is
absent
when
the
octamer
element
has
been
mutated
.

Based
on
these
data
,
and
the
conservation
of
the
5'-CAGCTG-3
'
motif
among
human
and
murine
kappa
promoters
,
we
propose
that
AP-4
is
the
major
ligand
for
Ig-kappa
promoter
E-boxes
.

A
16-mer
peptide
(
RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK
)
from
antennapedia
preferentially
targets
the
Class
I
pathway
.

Translocation
of
antigenic
peptides
into
the
cytosol
of
antigen
presenting
cells
facilitates
proteosomal
processing
and
loading
into
Class
I
molecules
for
MHC
presentation
on
the
cell
surface
.

The
DNA
binding
domain
of
the
Drosophila
transcription
factor
(
Antennapedia
)
,
a
60
amino
acid
protein
,
is
rapidly
taken
up
by
cells
and
has
been
fused
to
selected
antigens
to
enhance
their
immunogenicity
.

We
now
demonstrate
that
a
16
amino
acid
peptide
from
antennapedia
can
facilitate
the
cytoplasmic
uptake
of
CTL
epitope
9-mer
peptides
.

Synthetic
peptides
were
made
containing
the
16-mer
antennapedia
peptide
linked
in
tandem
to
the
ovalbumin
SIINFEKL
CTL
peptide
.

The
peptide
complex
was
shown
to
rapidly
internalise
into
APCs
by
confocal
microscopy
.

This
peptide
induced
CTL
in
C57BL/6
mice
and
protected
them
against
growth
of
an
ovalbumin
expressing
tumour
cell
line
(
E.G7-OVA
)
.

The
ability
of
the
hybrid
peptide
to
be
processed
and
presented
by
APCs
was
similar
,
whether
the
SIINFEKL
sequence
was
appended
at
the
C-terminus
or
N-terminus
of
the
Antennapedia
peptide
.

The
production
of
synthetic
peptides
containing
other
CTL
peptide
epitopes
may
be
useful
for
priming
CTLs
in
vitro
and
in
vivo

Bone
marrow
cells
promote
TH2
polarization
and
inhibit
virus-specific
CTL
generation
.

This
laboratory
recently
reported
that
human
bone
marrow
cells
(
BMC
)
inhibit
the
generation
of
virus-specific
CTL
in
culture
.

The
culture
supernatants
contained
increased
levels
of
prostaglandin
E
(
2
)
(
PGE
(
2
)
)
(
shown
to
favor
TH2
cell
development
)
and
also
inhibited
EBV-CTL
effector
cell
development
.

In
this
study
,
we
obtained
PBL
from
Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
IgG
antibody
positive
kidney
transplant
recipients
(
R
)
and
their
living-related
donors
(
LRD
)
one
year
after
renal
transplantation
.

EBV-specific
CTL
were
then
generated
in
vitro
by
stimulating
PBL
with
autologous
EBV-transformed
B
cells
(
EBV-B
)
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
autologous
BMC
.

The
addition
of
BMC
to
the
EBV-CTL
generation
cultures
increased
the
intracellular
expression
in
CD3+
cells
of
IL-4
,
-5
,
-6
,
-10
,
and
-13
.

These
CD3+
cells
also
expressed
increased
levels
of
the
TH2
associated
receptor
CCR3
.

Inhibition
was
even
observed
by
preparing
EBV-CTL
generating
cultures
in
trans-wells
that
separated
the
autologous
BMC
from
the
PBL
+
EBV-B
.

It
was
then
observed
that
CD3+
cells
obtained
after
7
days
of
culture
in
the
presence
of
autologous
BMC
could
be
used
as
inhibitors
of
EBV-CTL
generation
.

Protein
Kinase
A
(
PKA
)
,
a
cAMP
kinase
that
is
involved
in
the
upregulation
of
TH2
cytokine
activity
,
was
increased
in
EBV-CTL
cultures
by
the
presence
of
BMC
.

Additionally
,
IL-4-mediated
signal
transduction
and
activation
of
transcription
(
STAT-6
)
phosphorylation
was
slightly
increased
.

These
results
show
that
the
BMC
inhibition
is
mediated
by
soluble
factors
(
cytokines
)
and
that
cell-cell
contact
in
this
autologous
system
is
not
required
,
so
that
BMC
(
at
least
partially
,
via
cytokine
production
)
promote
TH2
polarization
in
culture
.

Moreover
,
TH2
cells
induced
by
culturing
with
autologous
BMC
directly
inhibit
EBV-CTL
generation
,
and
TH2
associated
PKA
,
CCR3
,
and
STAT-6
phosphorylation
are
enhanced
by
BMC
.

Reduction
in
DNA
binding
activity
of
the
transcription
factor
Pax-5a
in
B
lymphocytes
of
aged
mice
.

Aging
has
been
associated
with
intrinsic
changes
of
the
humoral
immune
response
,
which
may
lead
to
an
increased
occurrence
of
autoimmune
disorders
and
pathogenic
susceptibility
.

The
transcription
factor
Pax-5
is
a
key
regulator
of
B
cell
development
.

Pax-5a/B
cell-specific
activator
protein
and
an
alternatively
spliced
isoform
,
Pax-5d
,
may
have
opposing
functions
in
transcriptional
regulation
due
to
the
lack
of
a
transactivation
domain
in
Pax-5d
.

To
study
B
cell
-specific
changes
that
occur
during
the
aging
process
,
we
investigated
expression
patterns
of
Pax-5a
and
5d
in
mature
B
cells
of
young
and
aged
mice
.

RNase
protection
assays
showed
a
similar
transcriptional
pattern
for
both
age
groups
that
indicates
that
aging
has
no
affect
on
transcription
initiation
or
alternative
splicing
for
either
isoform
.

In
contrast
,
a
significant
reduction
in
the
DNA
binding
activity
of
Pax-5a
but
not
Pax-5d
protein
was
observed
in
aged
B
cells
in
vitro
,
while
Western
blot
analyses
showed
that
similar
levels
of
Pax-5a
and
5d
proteins
were
present
in
both
age
groups
.

The
observed
decrease
in
Pax-5a
binding
activity
correlated
with
changes
in
expression
of
two
Pax-5
target
genes
in
aged
B
cells
.

Expression
of
the
Ig
J
chain
and
the
secreted
form
of
Ig
mu
,
which
are
both
known
to
be
suppressed
by
Pax-5a
in
mature
B
cells
,
were
increased
in
B
cells
of
aged
mice
.

Together
,
our
studies
suggest
that
changes
associated
with
the
aging
phenotype
cause
posttranslational
modification
(
s
)
of
Pax-5a
but
not
Pax-5d
,
which
may
lead
to
an
abnormal
B
cell
phenotype
in
aged
mice
,
associated
with
elevated
levels
of
J
chain
,
and
secretion
of
IgM

NF-kappa
B/Rel
participation
in
the
lymphokine-dependent
proliferation
of
T
lymphoid
cells
.

Proliferative
responses
of
lymphoid
cells
to
IL-2
and
IL-4
depend
on
activation
of
the
cells
,
but
the
mechanism
(
s
)
by
which
activation
enhances
cellular
competence
to
respond
to
cytokines
is
not
fully
understood
.

The
NF-kappaB/Rel
family
represents
one
signal
transduction
pathway
induced
during
such
activation
.

We
show
in
this
study
that
inhibition
of
NF-kappaB
through
the
expression
of
an
IkappaBalpha
(
inhibitory
protein
that
dissociates
from
NF-kappaB
)
mutant
refractory
to
signal-induced
degradation
(
IkappaBalpha
(
DeltaN
)
)
interfered
with
the
acquisition
of
competence
to
proliferate
in
response
to
IL-4
as
well
as
IL-2
.

Thymocytes
and
T
cells
from
IkappaBalpha
(
DeltaN
)
transgenic
mice
expressed
normal
levels
of
IL-2R
subunits
.

However
,
transgenic
cells
exhibited
a
dramatic
defect
in
Stat5A
activation
treatment
with
IL-2
,
and
a
similar
defect
was
observed
for
IL-4
-induced
Stat5
.

In
contrast
,
T
lymphoid
cells
with
inhibition
of
NF-kappaB
showed
normal
insulin
receptor
substrate-2
phosphorylation
and
only
a
modest
decrease
in
Stat6
activation
and
insulin
receptor
substrate-1
phosphorylation
after
IL-4
stimulation
.

These
results
indicate
that
the
NF-kappaB/Rel/IkappaBalpha
system
can
regulate
cytokine
receptor
capacitation
through
effects
on
the
induction
of
downstream
signaling
by
the
Stat
transcription
factor
family
.

BMS-189453
,
a
novel
retinoid
receptor
antagonist
,
is
a
potent
testicular
toxin
.

BMS-189453
is
a
synthetic
retinoid
that
acts
as
an
antagonist
at
retinoic
acid
receptors
alpha
,
beta
,
and
gamma
.

In
Sprague
Dawley
rats
at
daily
oral
doses
of
15
,
60
,
or
240
mg/kg
for
1
month
,
BMS-189453
produced
increases
in
leukocyte
counts
,
alkaline
phosphatase
and
alanine
aminotransferase
levels
,
and
marked
testicular
degeneration
and
atrophy
at
all
doses
.

Significant
overt
signs
of
toxicity
and
deaths
occurred
at
240
mg/kg
,
whereas
body-weight
and
food-consumption
decreases
occurred
at
60
and
240
mg/kg
.

When
BMS-189453
was
administered
to
male
rats
at
daily
doses
ranging
from
12.5
to
100
mg/kg
for
1
week
,
only
minimal
testicular
changes
occurred
at
all
doses
,
shortly
after
the
dosing
period
.

However
,
after
a
1-month
drug-free
observation
period
,
marked
testicular
atrophy
was
evident
at
all
doses
.

BMS-189453
was
then
administered
at
doses
of
2
,
10
,
or
50
mg/kg
to
male
rats
for
1
,
3
,
or
7
consecutive
days
.

Dose-
and
duration-dependent
testicular
toxicity
that
occurred
after
a
1-month
observation
period
did
not
recover
,
and
,
in
some
cases
,
was
more
severe
4
months
after
the
last
dose
.

In
rabbits
administered
BMS-189453
at
oral
doses
of
2
,
10
,
or
50
mg/kg
for
1
week
,
testicular
degeneration
and
atrophy
were
evident
in
the
high-dose
group
at
1
month
following
treatment
.

These
studies
indicate
that
retinoid
antagonists
can
selectively
produce
progressive
and
prolonged
testicular
toxicity
after
single
or
repeated
oral
doses
that
are
otherwise
well
tolerated
.

Sequential
involvement
of
NFAT
and
Egr
transcription
factors
in
FasL
regulation
.

The
critical
function
of
NFAT
proteins
in
maintaining
lymphoid
homeostasis
was
revealed
in
mice
lacking
both
NFATp
and
NFAT4
(
DKO
)
.

DKO
mice
exhibit
increased
lymphoproliferation
,
decreased
activation-induced
cell
death
,
and
impaired
induction
of
FasL
.

The
transcription
factors
Egr2
and
Egr3
are
potent
activators
of
FasL
expression
.

Here
we
find
that
Egr2
and
Egr3
are
NFAT
target
genes
.

Activation
of
FasL
occurs
via
the
NFAT
-dependent
induction
of
Egr3
,
as
demonstrated
by
the
ability
of
exogenously
provided
NFATp
to
restore
Egr
-dependent
FasL
promoter
activity
in
DKO
lymph
node
cells
.

Further
,
Egr3
expression
is
enriched
in
Th1
cells
,
suggesting
a
molecular
basis
for
the
known
preferential
expression
of
FasL
in
the
Th1
versus
Th2
subset
.

Mechanisms
and
clinical
relevance
of
nongenomic
glucocorticoid
actions
.

Glucocorticoids
have
profound
anti-inflammatory
and
immunosuppressive
actions
when
used
therapeutically
.

The
therapeutic
dose
is
quite
variable
and
depends
on
the
disease
,
but
ranges
from
very
low
to
extremely
high
.

The
rationale
for
the
use
of
various
dosage
regimens
for
specific
clinical
indications
is
the
existence
of
three
distinct
,
therapeutically
relevant
effects
:
genomic
,
specific
nongenomic
and
unspecific
nongenomic
.

Genomic
effects
are
mediated
by
cytosolic
receptors
that
alter
expression
of
specific
genes
.

Specific
nongenomic
effects
occur
within
a
few
minutes
and
are
mediated
by
steroid-selective
membrane
receptors
.

Unspecific
nongenomic
effects
occur
within
seconds
,
but
only
at
high
glucocorticoid
dosages
,
and
seem
to
result
from
direct
interactions
with
biological
membranes
.

For
unspecific
nongenomic
effects
,
methylprednisolone
and
other
glucocorticoids
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
cation
cycling
across
the
plasma
membrane
,
but
to
have
little
effect
on
protein
synthesis
.

Thus
,
glucocorticoids
could
diminish
or
prevent
the
acute
immune
response
by
interfering
with
processes
such
as
the
rise
in
intracellular
Ca2+
concentration
.

It
is
proposed
that
the
additional
therapeutic
benefit
of
higher
doses
is
obtained
via
these
nongenomic
effects
.

High
glucose-induced
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
(
ICAM-1
)
expression
through
an
osmotic
effect
in
rat
mesangial
cells
is
PKC-NF-kappa
B-dependent
.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS
:
Infiltration
of
mononuclear
cells
and
glomerular
enlargement
accompanied
by
glomerular
cell
proliferation
are
very
early
characteristics
of
the
pathophysiology
of
diabetes
.

To
clarify
the
mechanism
of
early
diabetic
nephropathy
,
we
measured
[
3H
]
-thymidine
incorporation
and
cell
numbers
to
show
the
influence
of
a
high
ambient
glucose
concentration
and
the
osmotic
effect
on
rat
mesangial
cell
proliferation
.

We
also
measured
the
effect
of
high
glucose
on
the
expression
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
and
vascular
adhesion
molecule-1
by
flow
cytometry
and
semiquantitative
RT-PCR
in
mesangial
cells
and
the
adhesion
of
leukocytes
to
mesangial
cells
.

METHODS/RESULTS
:
Cells
exposed
to
high
D-glucose
(
30
mmol/l
)
caused
an
increase
in
[
3H
]
-thymidine
incorporation
and
cell
numbers
at
24
and
48
h
and
normalized
at
72
h
(
p
<
0.05
)
,
whereas
these
changes
were
not
found
in
high
mannitol
(
30
mmol/l
)
,
IL-1
beta
,
or
TNF
alpha
-stimulated
mesangial
cells
.

Cells
exposed
to
high-glucose
(
15
,
30
,
or
60
mmol/l
)
or
osmotic
agents
(
L-glucose
,
raffinose
and
mannitol
)
showed
that
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
expression
began
to
increase
after
24
h
,
reached
its
maximum
at
24
and
48
h
and
gradually
decreased
afterwards
.

The
stimulatory
effects
of
high
glucose
and
high
mannitol
on
mRNA
expression
were
observed
as
early
as
6
h
and
reached
its
maximum
at
12
h
.

Up-regulation
of
ICAM-1
protein
and
mRNA
was
also
found
in
IL-1-beta
and
TNF-alpha
-stimulated
mesangial
cells
.

Neither
vascular
adhesion
molecule-1
protein
nor
mRNA
expression
was
,
however
,
affected
by
high
glucose
and
high
mannitol
.

Notably
,
the
protein
kinase
C
inhibitors
calphostin
C
and
staurosporine
reduced
high
glucose-
or
high
mannitol-induced
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
mRNA
expression
and
high
glucose-induced
proliferation
.

Furthermore
,
the
NF-kappa
B
inhibitor
N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine
chloromethyl
ketone
reduced
high
glucose-
or
high
mannitol-induced
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
mRNA
expression
and
high
glucose-induced
proliferation
.

Results
showed
that
high
glucose
(
15
,
30
mmol/l
)
or
high
concentrations
of
osmotic
agents
remarkably
increased
the
number
of
adherent
leukocytes
to
mesangial
cells
(
p
<
0.01
)
compared
with
control
cells
(
5
mmol/l
D-glucose
)
.

Functional
blocking
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
on
mesangial
cells
with
rat
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
monoclonal
antibody
,
calphostin
C
,
staurosporine
,
or
N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine
chloromethyl
ketone
significantly
inhibited
high
glucose-
or
high
mannitol-induced
increase
in
leukocyte
adhesion
(
p
<
<
0.05
)
.

CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION
:
These
results
suggest
that
high
glucose
can
upregulate
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
protein
and
mRNA
expression
but
not
vascular
adhesion
molecule-1
expression
in
mesangial
cells
and
promote
leukocyte
adhesion
through
up-regulation
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
through
osmotic
effect
,
possibly
depending
on
the
protein
kinase
C
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(
PKC
-
NF-kappa
B
)
pathway
.

High
glucose
itself
can
also
promote
mesangial
cell
proliferation
through
the
PKC-NF-kappa
B
pathways
.

We
conclude
that
hyperglycaemia
in
itself
seems
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
development
of
early
diabetic
nephropathy
.

Combined
corticosteroid/
granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
therapy
in
the
treatment
of
severe
congenital
neutropenia
unresponsive
to
G-CSF
:
Activated
glucocorticoid
receptors
synergize
with
G-CSF
signals
.

More
than
90
%
of
patients
with
severe
congenital
neutropenia
(
SCN
)
respond
to
granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
therapy
.

The
basis
for
the
refractory
state
in
the
remaining
patients
is
unknown
.

To
address
this
issue
,
we
studied
a
child
with
SCN
who
was
totally
unresponsive
to
G-CSF
and
had
a
novel
point
mutation
in
the
extracellular
domain
of
the
G-CSF
receptor
(
GCSF-R
)
.

Marrow
stromal
support
of
granulopoiesis
was
evaluated
by
plating
CD34
(
+
)
cells
on
preformed
stromal
layers
.

Nonadherent
cells
were
harvested
and
assayed
in
clonogenic
assays
for
granulocytic
colony
production
.

The
in
vitro
effect
of
G-CSF
and
corticosteroids
on
granulopoiesis
was
evaluated
in
clonogenic
assays
of
marrow
mononuclear
cells
,
by
proliferation
studies
of
the
murine
myeloid
cell
line
32D
expressing
the
patient
's
mutated
G-CSFR
,
and
by
measuring
STAT5
activation
in
nuclear
extracts
from
stimulated
cells
.

Patient
's
stroma
supported
granulopoiesis
derived
from
control
marrow
CD34
(
+
)
cells
in
a
normal
manner
.

Normal
stroma
,
however
,
failed
to
induce
granulopoiesis
from
patient
's
CD34
(
+
)
cells
.

Clonogenic
assays
of
the
patient
's
marrow
mononuclear
cells
incorporating
either
G-CSF
or
hydrocortisone
produced
little
neutrophil
growth
.

In
contrast
,
inclusion
of
both
G-CSF
and
hydrocortisone
in
the
cytokine
``
cocktail
''
markedly
increased
the
neutrophil
numbers
.

Proliferation
of
32D
cells
expressing
the
mutated
receptor
and
STAT5
activation
were
improved
by
a
combination
of
G-CSF
and
dexamethasone
.

When
small
daily
doses
of
oral
prednisone
were
then
administered
to
the
patient
with
conventional
doses
of
subcutaneous
G-CSF
,
the
patient
responded
with
increased
neutrophil
numbers
and
with
a
complete
reversal
of
the
infectious
problems
.

These
data
provide
insight
into
SCN
unresponsive
to
standard
G-CSF
treatment
and
to
the
potential
corrective
action
of
combined
treatment
with
G-CSF
and
corticosteroids
through
synergistic
activation
of
STAT5
.

Human
renal
mesangial
cells
are
a
target
for
the
anti-inflammatory
action
of
9-cis
retinoic
acid
.

Mesangial
cells
play
an
active
role
in
the
inflammatory
response
to
glomerular
injury
.

We
have
studied
in
cultured
human
mesangial
cells
(
CHMC
)
several
effects
of
9-cis
retinoic
acid
(
9-cRA
)
,
an
activator
of
both
retinoic
acid
receptors
(
RARs
)
and
retinoid
X
receptors
(
RXRs
)
.

9-cRA
inhibited
foetal
calf
serum-induced
CHMC
proliferation
.

It
also
prevented
CHMC
death
induced
by
the
inflammatory
mediator
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
.

This
preventive
effect
was
not
due
to
any
increase
in
H
(
2
)
O
(
2
)
catabolism
and
it
persisted
even
when
both
catalase
and
glutathione
synthesis
were
inhibited
.

Finally
,
9-cRA
diminished
monocyte
adhesion
to
FCS-stimulated
CHMC
.

Interestingly
,
the
retinoid
also
inhibited
in
FCS-stimulated
cells
the
protein
expression
of
two
mesangial
adhesion
molecules
,
fibronectin
and
osteopontin
,
but
it
did
not
modify
the
protein
expression
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
and
vascular
adhesion
molecule-1
.

All
major
RARs
and
RXRs
isotypes
were
expressed
in
CHMC
regardless
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
9-cRA
.

Transcripts
to
RAR-alpha
,
RAR-beta
and
RXR-alpha
increased
after
incubation
with
9-cRA
whereas
RXR-gamma
was
inhibited
,
suggesting
a
major
role
for
RARs
and
RXRs
in
9-cRA-anti-inflammatory
effects
.

9-cRA
was
toxic
only
at
50
microM
(
a
concentration
50
-
5000
times
higher
than
required
for
the
effects
above
)
.

Cell
death
occurred
by
apoptosis
,
whose
onset
was
associated
with
a
pronounced
increase
in
catalase
activity
and
reduced
glutathione
content
,
being
more
effectively
induced
by
all-trans
retinoic
acid
.

Modulation
of
the
oxidant/antioxidant
balance
failed
to
inhibit
apoptosis
.

We
conclude
that
mesangial
cells
might
be
a
target
for
the
treatment
of
inflammatory
glomerulopathies
with
9-cRA
.

Expression
of
mammalian
defensin
genes
.

Antimicrobial
peptides
are
a
prevalent
mechanism
of
host
defense
found
throughout
nature
.

In
mammals
,
defensins
are
among
the
most
abundant
of
these
broad-spectrum
antibiotics
,
and
are
expressed
in
epithelial
and
hematopoietic
cells
.

The
defensin
peptides
are
especially
abundant
in
neutrophils
;
however
,
gene
expression
is
limited
to
the
promyelocyte
stage
.

In
epithelial
cells
,
defensin
genes
are
found
as
both
constitutively
expressed
and
inducible
.

Induction
has
been
observed
in
vitro
by
stimulation
with
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
as
well
as
inflammatory
mediators
.

In
vivo
,
up-regulation
of
several
defensin
genes
occurs
in
both
infectious
and
inflammatory
states
.

Gene
regulation
occurs
via
signal
transduction
pathways
common
to
other
innate
immune
responses
,
utilizing
transcription
factors
such
as
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappaB
and
NF
interleukin-6
.

Together
,
the
data
suggest
a
broad-based
innate
host
defense
whereby
potent
antimicrobial
peptides
are
present
to
prevent
initial
colonization
by
pathogenic
microorganisms
.

In
addition
,
the
recognition
of
bacteria
coupled
with
a
nascent
inflammatory
response
can
bolster
this
defense
by
a
coordinated
up-regulation
of
the
peptides
.

Multiple
signals
required
for
cyclic
AMP-responsive
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
binding
protein
interaction
induced
by
CD3/CD28
costimulation
.

The
optimal
activation
of
cAMP-responsive
element
binding
protein
(
CREB
)
,
similar
to
the
full
activation
of
T
lymphocytes
,
requires
the
stimulation
of
both
CD3
and
CD28
.

Using
a
reporter
system
to
detect
interaction
of
CREB
and
CREB-binding
protein
(
CBP
)
,
in
this
study
we
found
that
CREB
binds
to
CBP
only
by
engagement
of
both
CD3
and
CD28
.

CD3/CD28
-promoted
CREB
-
CBP
interaction
was
dependent
on
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAPK
)
and
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein
kinase
(
CaMK
)
IV
in
addition
to
the
previously
identified
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
pathway
.

Extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
,
CaMKIV
,
and
p38
MAPK
were
also
the
kinases
involved
in
CREB
Ser
(
133
)
phosphorylation
induced
by
CD3/CD28
.

A
reconstitution
experiment
illustrated
that
optimum
CREB
-
CBP
interaction
and
CREB
trans-activation
were
attained
when
these
three
kinase
pathways
were
simultaneously
activated
in
T
cells
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
coordinated
activation
of
different
kinases
leads
to
full
activation
of
CREB
.

Notably
,
CD28
ligation
activated
p38
MAPK
and
CaMKIV
,
the
kinases
stimulated
by
CD3
engagement
,
suggesting
that
CD28
acts
by
increasing
the
activation
extent
of
p38
MAPK
and
CaMKIV
.

These
results
support
the
model
of
a
minimum
activation
threshold
for
CREB
-
CBP
interaction
that
can
be
reached
only
when
both
CD3
and
CD28
are
stimulated
.

The
murine
IL-2
promoter
contains
distal
regulatory
elements
responsive
to
the
Ah
receptor
,
a
member
of
the
evolutionarily
conserved
bHLH-PAS
transcription
factor
family
.

Signaling
through
the
TCR
and
costimulatory
signals
primarily
control
transcription
of
the
IL-2
gene
in
naive
T
cells
.

The
minimal
promoter
necessary
for
this
expression
lies
proximal
,
between
-300
and
the
transcription
start
site
.

We
had
previously
shown
that
activation
of
the
arylhydrocarbon
receptor
(
AHR
)
,
a
member
of
the
bHLH-PAS
family
of
transcription
factors
,
leads
to
increased
mRNA
expression
of
IL-2
in
murine
fetal
thymocytes
.

The
AHR
is
abundant
in
the
thymus
and
may
play
a
role
for
the
development
of
the
immune
system
.

Moreover
,
its
overactivation
by
chemicals
such
as
dioxins
leads
to
immunosuppression
and
thymic
involution
.

Binding
motifs
for
the
liganded
AHR
can
be
identified
in
the
distal
region
-1300
to
-800
of
the
mouse
IL-2
promoter
.

We
show
here
that
these
DNA
motifs
,
the
so-called
dioxin
response
elements
,
after
binding
to
the
liganded
AHR
are
sufficient
to
transactivate
luciferase
expression
in
a
reporter
gene
system
.

The
IL-2
gene
can
be
induced
by
the
AHR
also
in
thymocytes
in
vivo
after
injection
of
2
,
3
,
7
,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
,
a
potent
ligand
of
the
AHR
.

The
AHR
mediates
the
IL-2
induction
as
shown
with
AHR
-deficient
mice
.

However
,
in
spleen
cells
in
vitro
costimulation
via
the
TCR
is
necessary
for
optimal
IL-2
gene
induction
.

Thus
,
the
IL-2
promoter
region
contains
novel
distal
regulatory
elements
that
can
be
addressed
by
the
AHR
to
induce
IL-2
and
can
cooperate
with
the
proximal
promoter

Visualization
of
Syk-antigen
receptor
interactions
using
green
fluorescent
protein
:
differential
roles
for
Syk
and
Lyn
in
the
regulation
of
receptor
capping
and
internalization
.

The
cross-linking
of
the
B
cell
Ag
receptor
(
BCR
)
is
coupled
to
the
stimulation
of
multiple
intracellular
signal
transduction
cascades
via
receptor-associated
,
protein
tyrosine
kinases
of
both
the
Src
and
Syk
families
.

To
monitor
changes
in
the
subcellular
distribution
of
Syk
in
B
cells
responding
to
BCR
cross-linking
,
we
expressed
in
Syk
-deficient
DT40
B
cells
a
fusion
protein
consisting
of
Syk
coupled
to
green
fluorescent
protein
.

Treatment
of
these
cells
with
anti-IgM
Abs
leads
to
the
recruitment
of
the
kinase
from
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
compartments
to
the
site
of
the
cross-linked
receptor
at
the
plasma
membrane
.

The
Syk-receptor
complexes
aggregate
into
membrane
patches
that
redistribute
to
form
a
cap
at
one
pole
of
the
cell
.

Syk
is
not
demonstrably
associated
with
the
internalized
receptor
.

Catalytically
active
Syk
promotes
and
stabilizes
the
formation
of
tightly
capped
BCR
complexes
at
the
plasma
membrane
.

Lyn
is
not
required
for
the
recruitment
of
Syk
to
the
cross-linked
receptor
,
but
is
required
for
the
internalization
of
the
clustered
BCR
complexes
.

In
the
absence
of
Lyn
,
receptor-Syk
complexes
at
the
plasma
membrane
are
long
lived
,
and
the
receptor-mediated
activation
of
the
NF-AT
transcription
factor
is
enhanced
.

Thus
,
Lyn
appears
to
function
to
negatively
regulate
aspects
of
BCR
-dependent
signaling
by
stimulating
receptor
internalization
and
down-regulation
.

Renal
interstitial

is
reduced
in
angiotensin

type
1a
receptor
-deficient
mice
.

Unilateral
ureteral
obstruction
(
UUO
)
results
in
tubulointerstitial
fibrosis
of
the
affected
kidney
by
stimulating
the
renin-angiotensin
system
.

This
study
established
a
UUO
model
in
angiotensin
type
1a
receptor
(
AT1a
)
deficient
(
mutant
)
mice
to
elucidate
the
role
of
angiotensin
II
through
AT1a
on
the
fibrosis
of
the
obstructed
kidney
(
OBK
)
.

The
relative
volume
of
the
tubulointerstitium
was
measured
by
an
image
analyzer
;
deposition
of
collagen
types
III
and
IV
and
monocyte
/
macrophage
infiltration
were
histologically
examined
using
specific
antibodies
.

Also
determined
were
the
mRNA
levels
of
transforming
growth
factor-beta
by
Northern
blot
analysis
.

Nuclear
factor-kappaB
activity
was
assessed
by
gel
shift
assay
.

UUO
in
wild
mice
resulted
in
a
marked
expansion
of
relative
volume
of
the
tubulointerstitium
,
together
with
increased
deposition
of
collagen
types
III
and
IV
and
number
of
infiltrated
monocytes
/
macrophages
in
the
interstitium
,
relative
to
sham-operated
mice
.

In
comparison
,
these
changes
were
significantly
lower
in
mutant
mice
with
UUO
.

The
mRNA
level
of
transforming
growth
factor-beta
was
significantly
higher
in
the
OBK
of
wild
mice
with
UUO
compared
with
sham-operated
mice
.

In
contrast
,
the
increase
in
mRNA
level
in
the
OBK
of
mutant
mice
was
significantly
less
than
in
wild
mice
.

Finally
,
UUO
resulted
in
activation
of
nuclear
factor-kappaB
in
wild
mice
but
was
inhibited
in
the
OBK
of
mutant
mice
.

The
results
provide
direct
evidence
that
angiotensin
II
acting
via
the
AT1a
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
the
development
of
tubulointerstitial
fibrosis
in
UUO
.

Ag-specific
CD4+
T
cells
are
present
in
peripheral
blood
in
low
frequency
,
where
they
undergo
recruitment
and
expansion
during
immune

and
in
the
pathogenesis
of
numerous
autoimmune
diseases
.

MHC
tetramers
,
which
constitute
a
labeled
MHC-peptide
ligand
suitable
for
binding
to
the
Ag-specific
receptor
on
T
cells
,
provide
a
novel
approach
for
the
detection
and
characterization
of
such
rare
cells
.

In
this
study
,
we
utilized
this
technology
to
identify
HLA
DQ
-restricted
Ag-specific
T
cells
in
the
peripheral
blood
of
human
subjects
and
to
identify
immunodominant
epitopes
associated
with
viral
infection
.

Peptides
representing
potential
epitope
regions
of
the
VP16
protein
from
HSV-2
were
loaded
onto
recombinant
DQ0602
molecules
to
generate
a
panel
of
Ag-specific
DQ0602
tetramers
.

VP16
Ag
-specific
DQ-restricted
T
cells
were
identified
and
expanded
from
the
peripheral
blood
of
HSV-2-infected
individuals
,
representing
two
predominant
epitope
specificities
.

Although
the
VP16
369-380
peptide
has
a
lower
binding
affinity
for
DQ0602
molecules
than
the
VP16
33-52
peptide
,
T
cells
that
recognized
the
VP16
369-380
peptide
occurred
at
a
much
higher
frequency
than
those
that
were
specific
for
the
VP16
33-52
peptide
.

Down-regulation
of
BOB.1/OBF.1
and
Oct2
in
classical
Hodgkin
disease
but
not
in
lymphocyte
predominant
Hodgkin
disease
correlates
with
immunoglobulin
transcription
.

In
contrast
to
the
tumor
cells
(
L
&
H
cells
)
of
lymphocyte
predominant
Hodgkin
disease
(
LPHD
)
,
Hodgkin
and
Reed-Sternberg
(
HRS
)
cells
of
classical
Hodgkin
disease
(
cHD
)
are
unable
to
transcribe
immunoglobulin
,
despite
the
presence
of
rearranged
immunoglobulin
genes
.

Although
initial
studies
have
suggested
crippling
immunoglobulin
gene
mutations
to
be
the
cause
of
absent
immunoglobulin
expression
in
cHD
,
recent
work
of
our
group
has
demonstrated
an
impaired
activation
of
the
immunoglobulin
promoter
as
a
superior
mechanism
.

As
immunoglobulin
transcription
is
mainly
regulated
by
the
B-cell
transcription
factors
Oct2
and
BOB.1/OBF.1
,
we
analyzed
35
cases
of
LPHD
,
32
cases
of
cHD
,
and
2
Hodgkin
disease
cell
lines
for
the
expression
of
these
transcription
factors
and
also
in
parallel
for
immunoglobulin
expression
.

Our
results
demonstrate
an
absence
of
Oct2
and/or
BOB.1/OBF.1
in
cHD
and
a
striking
overexpression
of
Oct2
in
LPHD
.

Immunoglobulin
expression
was
lacking
in
cHD
but
present
in
LPHD
.

Furthermore
,
the
reintroduction
of
BOB.1/OBF.1
and
Oct2
into
cultured
HRS
cells
restored
the
activity
of
cotransduced
immunoglobulin
promoter
constructs
.

Our
findings
dismiss
the
concept
that
the
different
immunoglobulin
expression
in
cHD
and
LPHD
is
due
to
disrupting
mutations
of
immunoglobulin
V
genes
in
cHD
but
is
most
likely
due
to
a
down-regulation
of
Oct2
and/or
BOB.1/OBF.1
.

This
study
further
revealed
Oct2
as
a
new
and
valuable
marker
for
the
identification
of
L
&
H
cells
and
their
distinction
from
HRS
cells
.

The
impairment
of
immunoglobulin
transcription
with
a
down-regulated
synthesis
of
Oct2
and
BOB.1/OBF.1
is
the
first
established
general
recurrent
defect
found
in
HRS
cells
.

Constitutive

of
NF-kappa
B

:
implications
for
apoptosis
resistance
and
pathogenesis
.

The
NF-kappa
B
family
of
transcription
factors
is
an
important
regulator
of
genes
expressed
during
inflammatory
responses
,
immunoglobulin
(
Ig
)
class
switching
,
cellular
differentiation
,
and
apoptosis
.

Recently
,
members
of
the
NF-kappaB
family
,
including
p65
(
Rel

)
,
have
been
implicated
in
promoting
survival
of
various
hematopoeitic
neoplasms
,
including
T
cell
malignancies
such
as
adult
T
cell
leukemia-lymphoma
.

We
investigated
the
expression
of
active
NF-kappa
B
p65
(
Rel
A
)
in
cases
of
mycosis
fungoides
(
MF
)
and
the
effect
of
chemical
inhibitors
of
NF-kappa
B
on
apoptosis
in
cutaneous
T
cell
lymphoma
(
CTCL
)

lines
.

Paraffin-embedded
tissues
from
23
cutaneous
lesions
and
a
single
lymph
node
biopsy
from
patients
diagnosed
with
MF
were
evaluated
for
p65
(
Rel

)
expression
by
using
a
monoclonal
mouse
antibody
that
detects
the
activated
form
of
p65
(
Rel

)
.

Apoptosis
after
treatment
with
the
NF-kappa
B
inhibitors
gliotoxin
,
MG132
,
BAY
11-7082
,
and
BAY
11-7085
was
quantitatively
measured
in
the
CTCL
cell
lines
HuT-78
and
HH
by
propidium

(
PI
)
/cell
cycle
analysis
for
detection
of
a

)
population
and
by
determination
of
increased
Annexin

D
(
7-AAD
)
expression
.

Nuclear
extracts
from
CTCL
cells
before
and
after
chemical
inhibition
were
analyzed
for
NF-kappa
B
nuclear
DNA-binding
activity
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
(
EMSA
)
with
quantitative
densitometry
.

Nuclear
expression
of
p65
(
Rel
A
)
before
and
after
treatment
with
the
various
inhibitory
compounds
was
measured
by
immunofluorescence
staining
in
each
CTCL
cell
line
.

Neoplastic
T
lymphocytes
from
22
of
24
cases
of
MF
showed
strong
nuclear
and
cytoplasmic
expression
of
active
p65
(
Rel
A
)
.

Compared
with
untreated
control
cells
,
a
marked
increase
in
apoptosis
,
a
significant
decrease
in
NF-kappa
B
DNA-binding
activity
,
and
a
marked
decrease
in
nuclear
p65
(
Rel
A
)
expression
were
seen
in
cells
from
both
CTCL
cell
lines
after
chemical
NF-kappa
B
inhibition
.

These
data
show
that
the
active
form
of
NF-kappa
B
p65
(
Rel
A
)
is
commonly
expressed
in
neoplastic
T
lymphocytes
in
patients
with
MF
.

In
CTCL
cell
lines
,
the
significant
decrease
in
nuclear
NF-kappa
B
expression
and
the
marked
increase
in
spontaneous
apoptosis
caused
by
chemical
NF-kappa
B
inhibition
suggest
a
critical
role
for
NF-kappa
B
in
the
pathogenesis
and
tumor
cell
maintenance
of
CTCLs
.

Human
T-cell
leukemia
virus
type
1
tax
protein
activates
transcription
through
AP-1
site
by
inducing
DNA
binding
activity
in
T
cells
.

Human
T-cell
leukemia
virus
type
1
(
HTLV-1
)
Tax
protein
induces
the
expression
of
various
family
members
of
the
transcription
factor
AP-1
,
such
as
c-Jun
,
JunD
,
c-Fos
,
and
Fra-1
,
at
the
level
of
RNA
expression
in
T
cells
.

We
examined
the
activity
of
Tax
in
transcription
through
AP-1-binding
sites
(
AP-1
site
)
in
T
cells
.

Transient
transfection
studies
showed
that
Tax
activated
the
expression
of
a
luciferase
gene
regulated
by
two
copies
of
an
AP-1
site
in
the
human
Jurkat
T-cell
line
.

Tax
activates
the
expression
of
viral
and
cellular
genes
through
two
different
enhancers
:
a
cAMP-responsive
(
CRE
)
-like
element
and
a
kappaB
element
.

Two
Tax
mutants
differentially
activated
expression
of
these
two
elements
.

Tax703
preferentially
activated
the
kappaB
element
but
not
the
CRE-like
one
,
whereas
TaxM22
showed
the
reverse
.

In
addition
,
Tax703
and
Tax
,
but
not
TaxM22
,
converted
cell
growth
of
a
mouse
T-cell
line
from
being
interleukin
(
IL
)
-2-dependent
to
being
IL-2-independent
.

Unlike
the
wild-type
Tax
,
Tax703
and
TaxM22
only
weakly
activated
the
AP-1
site
in
the
T-cell
line
.

Thus
,
Tax
seems
to
activate
the
AP-1
site
via
mechanisms
distinct
from
those
of
kappaB
or
CRE-like
elements
,
and
the
activation
of
the
AP-1
site
is
dispensable
for
IL-2-independent
growth
of
CTLL-2
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
showed
that
Tax
induced
strong
binding
activity
to
an
AP-1
site
in
CTLL-2
,
whereas
Tax703
did
not
,
indicating
that
the
induction
of
binding
activity
to
the
AP-1
site
is
essential
for
the
transcriptional
activation
by
Tax
.

The
binding
complex
induced
by
Tax
in
CTLL-2
contained
JunD
and
Fra-2
.

Other
AP-1
proteins
were
undetectable
.

Activation
of
transcription
through
the
AP-1
site
in
Jurkat
cells
by
JunD
and/or
Fra-2
was
weak
.

c-Jun
,
JunB
,
and
c-Fos
activation
was
greater
,
although
the
level
was
still
less
than
that
with
Tax
.

Thus
,
the
induction
of
AP-1
mRNA
by
Tax
may
not
be
sufficient
for
a
complete
activation
of
AP-1
site
by
Tax
.

Our
results
suggest
that
Tax
activates
the
transcription
of
cellular
genes
with
AP-1
sites
by
inducing
the
DNA-binding
activity
of
AP-1
proteins
in
T
cells
,
a
mechanism
distinct
from
those
of
CRE-like
and
kappaB
elements
.

Strict
control
of
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
replication
by
a
genetic
switch
:
Tet
for
Tat
.

Live-attenuated
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
variants
have
shown
great
promise
as
AIDS
vaccines
,
but
continued
replication
can
lead
to
the
selection
of
faster-replicating
variants
that
are
pathogenic
.

We
therefore
designed
HIV-1
genomes
that
replicate
exclusively
upon
addition
of
the
nontoxic
effector
doxycycline
(
dox
)
.

This
was
achieved
by
replacement
of
the
viral
TAR-Tat
system
for
transcriptional
activation
by
the
Escherichia
coli-derived
Tet
system
for
inducible
gene
expression
.

These
designer
``
HIV-rtTA
''
viruses
replicate
in
a
strictly
dox-dependent
manner
both
in
a
T-cell
line
and
in
primary
blood
cells
,
and
the
rate
of
replication
can
be
fine-tuned
by
simple
variation
of
the
dox
concentration
.

These
HIV-rtTA
viruses
provide
a
tool
to
perform
genetics
,
e.g.
,
selection
and
optimization
experiments
,
with
the
E.
coli-derived
Tet
reagents
in
a
eukaryotic
background
.

Furthermore
,
such
viruses
may
represent
improved
vaccine
candidates
because
their
replication
can
be
turned
on
and
off
at
will
.

Synovial
fluid
induced
nuclear
factor-kappaB
DNA
binding
in
a
monocytic
cell
line
.

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
effects
of
synovial
fluids
(
SF
)
on
DNA
binding
activity
of
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor-kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
in
the
Mono
Mac
6
monocytic/macrophage
cell
line
as
a
model
for
the
interaction
between
SF
and
synovial
tissue
macrophages
in
arthritis
.

METHODS
:
Mono
Mac
6
cells
were
incubated
with
SF
from
the
knee
joints
of
human
subjects
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
,
undifferentiated
seronegative
oligoarthritis
,
and
osteoarthritis
(
OA
)
.

Nuclear
extracts
prepared
from
the
Mono
Mac
6
cells
and
RA
synovial
tissue
were
analyzed
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
analysis
(
EMSA
)
for
NF-kappaB
DNA
binding
proteins
.

RESULTS
:
Induction
of
NF-kappaB
DNA
binding
by
the
p65
(
RelA
)
/p50
heterodimer
was
observed
in
response
to
incubation
of
Mono
Mac
6
cells
with
SF
(
20
%
in
culture
medium
)
from
5
of
8
subjects
with
RA
,
4
of
5
with
OA
,
and
none
of
3
with
undifferentiated
seronegative
oligoarthritis
.

Incubation
of
SF
with
neutralizing
antibodies
against
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
,
but
not
antibodies
against
interleukin
6
(
IL-6
)
,
significantly
reduced
the
induction
of
p65/p50
binding
activity
in
SF
from
subjects
with
RA
and
OA
.

Unexpectedly
,
a
slowly
migrating
SF
inducible
NF-kappaB
-binding
complex
was
observed
in
EMSA
of
Mono
Mac
6
cells
after
incubation
with
SF
from
5
of
8
RA
and
2
of
5
OA
subjects
.

The
induction
of
this
complex
by
SF
was
not
affected
by
neutralization
of
TNF-alpha
or
IL-6
in
SF
,
and
the
complex
was
not
inducible
by
TNF-alpha
,
IL-1beta
,
TNF-alpha
/
IL-1beta
,
IL-6
,
platelet
derived
growth
factor
,
lipopolysaccharide
,
or
tetradecanoyl
phorbol
acetate
.

The
slowly
migrating
complex
could
not
be
supershifted
with
antibodies
against
NF-kappaB
,
Jun
,
or
the
transcriptional
coactivators
p300
or
CBP
.

A
NF-kappaB-binding
complex
with
similar
slow
mobility
was
observed
in
nuclear
extracts
prepared
from
fresh
human
RA
synovial
tissue
.

CONCLUSION
:
Biological
activity
of
TNF-alpha
in
SF
from
RA
and
OA
subjects
is
capable
of
inducing
p65/p50
NF-kappaB
DNA
binding
activity
in
macrophages
.

A
property
of
SF
that
is
independent
of
TNF-alpha
and
other
cytokines
is
responsible
for
the
induction
of
a
novel
slowly
migrating
NF-kappaB-binding
complex
.

Soluble
mediators
in
SF
of
subjects
with
RA
and
OA
can
therefore
modulate
binding
of
nuclear
proteins
to
the
NF-kappaB
binding
site
in
macrophages
and
may
play
a
role
in
inflammatory
gene
expression
in
arthritis
.

The

evaluates
the

of
peroxisome

(
PPAR-gamma
)
on
B-lineage

.

Normal

reflective
of

of

(
e.g.

,

,
and

)
express
PPAR-gamma
mRNA
and
,
by
Western

analysis
,
the
67-kDa
PPAR-gamma
protein
.

15-Deoxy-Delta
(
12
,
14
)
-PGJ
(
2
)
(
15d-PGJ
(
2
)
)
,
a
PPAR-gamma
agonist
,
has
a
dose-dependent
antiproliferative
and
cytotoxic
effect
on
normal
and
malignant
B
cells
as
shown
by
[
(

)
H
]
thymidine
and
3-
[
4
,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl
]
-2
,
5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide
assays
.

Only
PPAR-gamma
agonists
(
thiazolidinediones
)
,
and
not
PPAR-alpha
agonists
,
mimicked
the
effect
of
15d-PGJ
(
2
)
on
B-lineage
cells
,
indicating
that
the
mechanism
by
which
15d-PGJ
(
2
)
negatively
affects
B-lineage
cells
involves
in
part
PPAR-gamma
.

The
mechanism
by
which
PPAR-gamma
agonists
induce
cytotoxicity
is
via
apoptosis
,
as
shown
by
annexin
V
staining
and
as
confirmed
by
DNA
fragmentation
detected
using
the
TUNEL
assay
.

Interestingly
,
addition
of
PGF
(
2alpha
)
,
which
was
not
known
to
affect
lymphocytes
,
dramatically
attenuated
the
deleterious
effects
of
PPAR-gamma
agonists
on
B
lymphomas
.

Surprisingly
,
15d-PGJ
(
2
)
induced
a
massive
increase
in
nuclear
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
activation
,
and
pretreatment
with
PGF
(
2alpha
)
blunted
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
activation
.

This
is
the
first
study
evaluating
PPAR-gamma
expression
and
its
significance
on
B
lymphocytes
.

PPAR-gamma
agonists
may
serve
as
a
counterbalance
to
the
stimulating
effects
of
other
PGs
,
namely
PGE
(
2
)
,
which
promotes
B
cell
differentiation
.

Finally
,
the
use
of
PGs
,
such
as
15d-PGJ
(
2
)
,
and
synthetic
PPAR-gamma
agonists
to
induce
apoptosis
in
B-lineage
cells
may
lead
to
the
development
of
novel
therapies
for
fatal
B
lymphomas

Inhibition
of
STAT3
signaling
leads
to
apoptosis
of
leukemic
large
granular
lymphocytes
and
decreased
Mcl-1
expression
.

Large
granular
lymphocyte
(
LGL
)
leukemia
is
characterized
by
the
expansion
of
antigen-activated
cytotoxic
T
lymphocytes
.

These
leukemic
cells
are
resistant
to
Fas-mediated
apoptosis
despite
expressing
high
levels
of
Fas
.

We
found
that
leukemic
LGL
from
19
patients
displayed
high
levels
of
activated
STAT3
.

Treatment
of
leukemic
LGL
with
the
JAK-selective
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
AG-490
induced
apoptosis
with
a
corresponding
decrease
in
STAT
-DNA
binding
activity
.

Moreover
,
using
an
antisense
oligonucleotide
approach
to
diminish
STAT3
expression
,
we
found
that
Fas
sensitivity
was
restored
in
leukemic
LGL
.

AG-490-induced
apoptosis
in
leukemic
LGL
was
independent
of
Bcl-xL
or
Bcl-2
expression
.

However
,
we
found
that
the
Bcl-2-family
protein
Mcl-1
was
significantly
reduced
by
AG-490
treatment
.

Activated
STAT3
was
shown
to
bind
an
SIE-related
element
in
the
murine
mcl-1
promoter
.

Using
a
luciferase
reporter
assay
,
we
demonstrated
that
v-src
overexpression
in
NIH3T3
induced
STAT3
-dependent
transcriptional
activity
from
the
mcl-1
promoter
and
increased
endogenous
Mcl-1
protein
levels
.

We
conclude
that
STAT3
activation
contributed
to
accumulation
of
the
leukemic
LGL
clones
.

These
findings
suggest
that
investigation
should
focus
on
novel
strategies
targeting
STAT3
in
the
treatment
of
LGL
leukemia
.

Decreased
immediate
inflammatory
gene
induction
in
activating
transcription
factor-2
mutant
mice
.

Transcription
factor
activating
transcription
factor
(
ATF
)
-2
is
activated
by
inflammatory
signals
transduced
by
the
JNK
and
p38
MAP
kinase
pathways
.

To
better
define
the
role
of
ATF-2
in
inflammation
,
adult
mice
expressing
small
amounts
of
a
mutant
ATF-2
protein
were
challenged
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
,
anti-CD3
antibody
or
virus
.

Within
3
h
of
challenge
by
LPS
,
ATF-2
mutant
mice
had
decreased
induction
of
the
adhesion
molecules
E-selectin
,
P-selectin
and
VCAM-1
as
well
as
the
cytokines
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
IL-1beta
and
IL-6
compared
with
control
mice
.

Stimulation
of
T
lymphocytes
by
anti-CD3
antibody
also
showed
less
induction
of
IL-1
and
IL-6
in
ATF-2
mutant
tissues
.

ATF-2
mutant
thymocytes
treated
with
anti-CD3
antibody
in
vitro
demonstrated
reduced
induction
of
c-Jun
,
JunB
,
JunD
and
Fra-2
.

However
,
similar
to
what
was
observed
after
p38
kinase
inhibition
in
normal
mice
,
relative
ATF-2
deficiency
did
not
prevent
the
development
of
a
mononuclear
cell
infiltrate
in
the
week
following
an
inflammatory
stimulus
.

ATF-2
mutant
mice
proved
more
susceptible
to
death
than
control
mice
from
LPS
plus
D-galactosamine
injection
or
Coxsackievirus
B3
infection
and
had
a
higher
incidence
of
mononuclear
pulmonary
infiltrates
after
exposure
to
Herpes
simplex
virus-1
.

ATF-2
is
essential
for
maximal
immediate
induction
of
adhesion
molecules
and
cytokine
genes
,
but
at
later
time
points
may
even
protect
against
overactive
immune
responses
.

LIGHT
,
a
TNF-like
molecule
,
costimulates
T
cell
proliferation
and
is
required
for
dendritic
cell
-mediated
allogeneic
T
cell
response
.

LIGHT
is
a
recently
identified
member
of
the
TNF
superfamily
and
its
receptors
,
herpesvirus
entry
mediator
and
lymphotoxin
beta
receptor
,
are
found
in
T
cells
and
stromal
cells
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
LIGHT
is
selectively
expressed
on
immature
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
generated
from
human
PBMCs
.

In
contrast
,
LIGHT
is
not
detectable
in
DCs
either
freshly
isolated
from
PBMCs
or
rendered
mature
in
vitro
by
LPS
treatment
.

Blockade
of
LIGHT
by
its
soluble
receptors
,
lymphotoxin
beta
receptor-Ig
or
HVEM-Ig
,
inhibits
the
induction
of
DC
-mediated
primary
allogeneic
T
cell
response
.

Furthermore
,
engagement
of
LIGHT
costimulates
human
T
cell
proliferation
,
amplifies
the
NF-kappaB
signaling
pathway
,
and
preferentially
induces
the
production
of
IFN-gamma
,
but
not
IL-4
,
in
the
presence
of
an
antigenic
signal
.

Our
results
suggest
that
LIGHT
is
a
costimulatory
molecule
involved
in
DC
-mediated
cellular
immune
responses
.

Suppression
of
HIV
type
1
replication
by
a
dominant-negative
Ets-1
mutant
.

Activity
of
the
distal
region
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV-1
)
long
terminal
repeat
(
LTR
)
,
which
contains
binding
sites
for
the
Ets-1
and
USF-1
proteins
,
is
integral
for
HIV-1
replication
.

The
Ets-1
and
USF-1
proteins
play
a
critical
role
in
the
activity
of
the
HIV-1
LTR
distal
enhancer
region
,
as
indicated
by
the
potent
dominant
negative
effect
of
a
mutant
Ets-1
lacking
trans-activation
domains
on
the
transcriptional
activity
of
the
LTR
.

To
determine
the
biological
relevance
of
the
Ets-1
and
USF-1
proteins
in
HIV-1
replication
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
expression
of
the
dominant-negative
mutant
of
Ets-1
(
dnEts-1
)
on
HIV-1
infection
of
T
cells
.

We
demonstrated
that
expression
of
dnEts
markedly
suppressed
HIV-1
infection
of
a
T
cell
line
.

This
finding
indicates
that
formation
of
a
transcriptionaly
active
USF-1/Ets-1
complex
is
important
in
the
productive
infection
of
cells
by
HIV-1
,
and
suggests
that
inhibition
of
the
interaction
between
USF-1
and
Ets-1
with
the
HIV-1
LTR
may
provide
a
new
target
for
anti-HIV-1
gene
therapy
.

Human
eosinophils
constitutively
express
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
p
and
c
.

BACKGROUND
:
Eosinophils
are
now
known
to
produce
a
variety
of
proinflammatory
cytokines
,
although
the
molecular
factors
that
regulate
their
production
are
poorly
understood
.

The
expression
of
almost
all
of
the
cytokines
produced
by
eosinophils
,
including
the
proallergic
cytokine
IL-4
,
is
now
known
to
be
regulated
at
the
level
of
transcription
by
members
of
the
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
family
of
transcription
factors
.

OBJECTIVE
:
We
sought
to
characterize
the
expression
of
different
NFAT
proteins
in
resting
and
activated
eosinophils
.

METHODS
:
Nuclear
and
whole
cell
extracts
were
obtained
from
both
peripheral
blood
eosinophils
and
those
obtained
from
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
of
asthmatic
subjects
after
endobronchial
allergen
challenge
.

NFAT
expression
was
determined
by
using
immunoprecipitation
and
Western
blot
analysis
,
DNA-binding
assays
,
and
RT-PCR
analysis
of
eosinophil
mRNA
.

RESULTS
:
Both
peripheral
blood
and
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
eosinophils
expressed
NFATp
and
NFATc
protein
.

Unlike
activated
T
cells
,
which
express
multiple
NFATc
isoforms
,
eosinophils
preferentially
express
the
approximately
85-kd
isoform
.

In
addition
,
eosinophils
were
found
to
constitutively
express
NFATc
mRNA
.

A
brief
incubation
with
the
T
(
H
)
2
cytokines
IL-4
and
IL-5
was
sufficient
to
induce
the
nuclear
translocation
of
NFATc
.

Eosinophil
nuclear
extracts
contain
multiple
factors
that
can
specifically
recognize
the
IL-4
promoter
P1
NFAT
site
in
DNA-binding
assays
,
including
NFATp
.

CONCLUSION
:
NFATp
and
NFATc
can
regulate
the
expression
of
cytokines
and
other
genes
in
eosinophils
but
appear
to
be
regulated
by
a
novel
signal
transduction
mechanism
in
these
cells
.

BLyS
BINDS
TO
B
CELLS
WITH
HIGH
AFFINITY
AND
INDUCES
ACTIVATION
OF
THE
TRANSCRIPTION
FACTORS
NF-kappaB
AND
ELF-1
.

B
lymphocyte
stimulator
(
BLyS
)
is
a
novel
member
of
the
TNF
family
of
proteins
expressed
by
myeloid
cells
as
membrane-bound
and
soluble
forms
.

BLyS
was
shown
to
act
specifically
on
B
cells
,
inducing
proliferation
and
immunoglobulin
production
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

The
present
study
was
undertaken
to
characterize
binding
of
radiolabeled
BLyS
to
its
cognate
receptor
on
human
B
lymphocytes
and
examine
intracellular
events
initiated
by
BLyS
binding
.

Similar
to
other
TNF
family
members
,
BLyS
is
present
in
solution
as
a
homotrimer
as
determined
by
gel
filtration
chromatography
and
light
scattering
analysis
.

BLyS
binding
to
B
cells
is
specific
as
other
TNF
family
members
tested
did
not
compete
for
(
125
)
I-
BLyS
binding
.

Analysis
of
equilibrium
binding
of
(
125
)
I-labeled
BLyS
to
purified
human
tonsillar
B
cells
demonstrated
saturable
binding
.

Scatchard
analysis
of
the
binding
data
revealed
a
single
class
of
high-affinity
binding
on
human
B
cells
with
approximately
2600
binding
sites
per
cell
and
an
apparent
dissociation
constant
(
K
(
D
)
)
of
about
0.1
nM
.

In
addition
we
report
that
BLyS
binding
to
B
cells
results
in
the
activation
of
NF-kappaB
and
the
Ets
family
transcription
factor
,
ELF-1
,
and
in
the
induction
of

Design
and
use
of
an
inducibly
activated
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
Nef
to
study
immune
modulation
.

The
Nef
protein
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
has
been
shown
to
enhance
the
infectivity
of
virus
particles
,
downmodulate
cell
surface
proteins
,
and
associate
with
many
intracellular
proteins
that
are
thought
to
facilitate
HIV
infection
.

One
of
the
challenges
in
defining
the
molecular
events
regulated
by
Nef
has
been
obtaining
good
expression
of
Nef
protein
in
T
cells
.

This
has
been
attributed
to
effects
of
Nef
on
cell
proliferation
and
apoptosis
.

We
have
designed
a
Nef
protein
that
is
readily
expressed
in
T-cell
lines
and
whose
function
is
inducibly
activated
.

It
is
composed
of
a
fusion
between
full-length
Nef
and
the
estrogen
receptor
hormone-binding
domain
(
Nef-ER
)
.

The
Nef-ER
is
kept
in
an
inactive
state
due
to
steric
hindrance
,
and
addition
of
the
membrane-permeable
drug
4-hydroxytamoxifen
(
4-HT
)
,
which
binds
to
the
ER
domain
,
leads
to
inducible
activation
of
Nef-ER
within
cells
.

We
demonstrate
that
Nef-ER
inducibly
associates
with
the
62-kDa
Ser/Thr
kinase
and
is
localized
to
specific
membrane
microdomains
(
lipid
rafts
)
only
after
activation
.

Using
this
inducible
Nef
,
we
also
compared
the
specific
requirements
for
CD4
and
HLA-A2
downmodulation
in
a
SupT1
T-cell
line
.

Half-maximal
downmodulation
of
cell
surface
CD4
required
very
little
active
Nef-ER
and
occurred
as
early
as
4
h
after
addition
of
4-HT
.

In
contrast
,
50
%
downmodulation
of
HLA-A2
by
Nef
required
16
to
24
h
and
about
50-
to
100-fold-greater
concentrations
of
4-HT
.

These
data
suggest
that
HLA-A2
downmodulation
may
require
certain
threshold
levels
of
active
Nef
.

The
differential
timing
of
CD4
and
HLA-A2
downmodulation
may
have
implications
for
HIV
pathogenesis
and
immune
evasion
.

Regulation
of
chemokine
mRNA
expression
in
a
rat
model
of
vanadium-induced
pulmonary
inflammation
.

Environmental
and
occupational
exposure
to
vanadium
dusts
results
in
toxic
effects
mainly
confined
to
the
respiratory
system
.

Using
a
rat
model
of
acute
lung
inflammation
induced
by
intratracheal
instillation
of
sodium
metavanadate
(
NaVO3
)
at
the
dose
of
200
microg
V/kg
,
we
investigated
the
relationship
between
the
cytologic
characterization
of
pulmonary
inflammation
and
the
expression
of
chemokine
mRNA
.

Significant
polymorphonuclear
leukocyte
(
PMN
)
influx
(
P
<
0.01
)
into
the
lung
was
noted
4
h
after
NaVO3
instillation
,
whereas
alveolar
macrophages
(
AMs
)
in
bronchoalveolar
lavage
(
BAL
)
cells
appeared
to
decrease
significantly
.

In
contrast
,
neither
PMNs
nor
AMs
changed
substantially
1
h
after
NaVO3
instillation
.

By
Northern
analysis
,
macrophage
inflammatory
protein
(
MIP
)
-2
mRNA
in
BAL
cells
increased
markedly
1
h
after
NaVO3
instillation
and
reduced
a
little
bit
at
4
h
,
whereas
MIP-1alpha
mRNA
in
BAL
cells
was
expressed
relatively
high
1
h
after
NaVO3
instillation
,
although
a
basal
expression
was
detected
in
control
group
,
and
returned
rapidly
nearly
to
control
level
at
4
h
.

Since
MIP-2
is
a
potent
PMN
chemoattractant
and
MIP-1alpha
is
a
potent
macrophage/monocyte
chemoattractant
has
been
well
known
.

The
facts
that
PMN
influx
was
preceded
by
increased
MIP-2
mRNA
expression
,
suggesting
that
MIP-2
is
involved
in
the
development
of
NaVO3-induced
pulmonary
inflammation
,
whereas
increased
MIP-1alpha
mRNA
expression
was
followed
by
decreased
AMs
in
BAL
cells
,
suggesting
AMs
might
be
activated
by
MIP-1alpha
,
adherent
to
the
lining
surface
of
the
airways
and
then
resistant
to
be
washed
out
.

To
delineate
the
mechanisms
of
transcriptional
activation
,
we
recently
cloned
the
5'-flanking
region
of
the
MIP-2
gene
.

The
promotor
region
contains
consensus
binding
sites
for
transcription
factor
nuclear
factor
kappaB
(
NF-kappaB
)
and
activator
protein-1
(
AP-1
)
.

Using
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
,
increased
nuclear
NF-kappaB
,
not
AP-1
,
binding
activity
was
detected
1
h
after
NaVO3
instillation
,
which
correlated
with
the
induction
of
MIP-2
mRNA
.

p65
(
Rel
A
)
and
p50
protein
appears
to
be
involved
in
MIP-2
NF-kappaB
binding
.

Taken
together
,
our
studies
suggest
that
MIP-2
is
an
important
mediator
of
NaVO3-induced
pulmonary
inflammation
in
the
rat
model
.

In
addition
,
elevated
MIP-2
mRNA
levels
are
accompanied
by
increased
NF-kappaB
binding
activity
in
BAL
cells
,
suggesting
possible
MIP-2
transcriptional
regulation
through
NF-kappaB
.

Activation
of
signal
transduction
and
apoptosis
in
healthy
lymphomonocytes
exposed
to
bystander
HIV-1-infected
cells
.

Persistent
activation
of
the
immune
system
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
HIV-1
infection
.

In
this
study
we
analysed
the
induction
of
factors
involved
in
cytokine
signal
transduction
,
such
as
STAT
1
proteins
and
IRF-1
mRNA
,
in
normal
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
exposed
to
HIV-infected
cells
,
and
the
induction
of
apoptosis
.

Western
blot
analyses
and
reverse
transcriptase-polymerase
chain
reaction
results
indicate
that
both
cells
infected
with
a
X4
strain
and
cells
infected
with
a
R5
strain
are
able
to
increase
intracellular
levels
of
STAT
1alpha
and
beta
proteins
as
well
as
IRF-1
mRNA
.

This
effect
was
prevented
by
neutralizing
antibodies
against
interferon-alpha
(
IFN-alpha
)
.

HIV-1-infected
cells
dose-dependently
induced
apoptotic
commitment
in
normal
PBMC
,
as
revealed
by
DNA
fragmentation
analysis
,
but
this
was
not
accompanied
by
an
increase
of
caspase-3
activity
,
even
if
a
slight
up-regulation
of
IL-1beta-converting
enzyme
mRNA
was
detected
.

Apoptosis
induction
could
be
abrogated
mainly
by
antibodies
against
tumour
necrosis
factor-alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
by
antibodies
against
IFN-gamma
.

All
these
findings
suggest
that
uninfected
PBMC
can
undergo
activation
of
signal
transduction
and
apoptosis
after
exposure
to
bystander
HIV-infected
cells
,
subsequent
to
the
induction
of
cytokines
such
as
IFNs
and
TNF-alpha
.

The
physical
association
of
protein
kinase
C
theta
with
a
lipid
raft-associated
inhibitor
of
kappa
B
factor
kinase
(
IKK
)
complex
plays
a
role
in
the
activation
of
the
NF-kappa
B
cascade
by
TCR
and
CD28
.

We
investigated
the
role
of
protein
kinase
C
theta
(
PKCtheta
)
in
the
activation
of
the
NF-kappaB
cascade
in
primary
human
CD4
(
+
)
lymphocytes
.

Among
six
or
so
PKC
isoforms
expressed
in
T
cells
,
only
PKCtheta
participates
in
the
assembly
of
the
supramolecular
activation
clusters
at
the
contact
site
of
the
TCR
with
Ag
.

Signaling
via
both
the
TCR
and
CD28
is
required
for
optimal
activation
of
the
multisubunit
IkappaB
kinase
(
IKK
)
complex
in
primary
human
T
lymphocytes
;
this
activation
could
be
inhibited
by
a
Ca
(
2+
)
-independent
PKC
isoform
inhibitor
,
rottlerin
.

Moreover
,
endogenous
PKCtheta
physically
associates
with
activated
IKK
complexes
in
CD3/CD28-costimulated
primary
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
.

The
same
set
of
stimuli
also
induced
relocation
of
endogenous
PKCtheta
and
IKKs
to
a
GM1
ganglioside-enriched
,
detergent-insoluble
membrane
compartment
in
primary
T
cells
.

IKKs
recruited
to
these
lipid
rafts
were
capable
of
phosphorylating
a
recombinant
IkappaBalpha
sustrate
.

Confocal
microscopy
further
demonstrated
that
exogenously
expressed
PKCtheta
and
IKKss
colocalize
in
the
membrane
of
CD3/CD28-costimulated
Jurkat
T
cells
.

Constitutively
active
but

element
of

Taken
together
,
these

show
that
the

of

by

T-cell
-mediated
regulation
of
osteoclastogenesis
by
signalling
cross-talk
between
RANKL
and
IFN-gamma
.

Bone
resorption
is
regulated
by
the
immune
system
,
where
T-cell
expression
of
RANKL
(
receptor
activator
of
nuclear
factor
(
NF
)
-kappaB
ligand
)
,
a
member
of
the
tumour-necrosis
factor
family
that
is
essential
for
osteoclastogenesis
,
may
contribute
to
pathological
conditions
,
such
as
autoimmune
arthritis
.

However
,
whether
activated
T
cells
maintain
bone
homeostasis
by
counterbalancing
the
action
of
RANKL
remains
unknown
.

Here
we
show
that
T-cell
production
of
interferon
(
IFN
)
-gamma
strongly
suppresses
osteoclastogenesis
by
interfering
with
the
RANKL
-RANK
signalling
pathway
.

IFN-gamma
induces
rapid
degradation
of
the
RANK
adapter
protein
,
TRAF6
(
tumour
necrosis
factor
receptor-associated
factor
6
)
,
which
results
in
strong
inhibition
of
the
RANKL
-induced
activation
of
the
transcription
factor
NF-kappaB
and
JNK
.

This
inhibition
of
osteoclastogenesis
is
rescued
by
overexpressing
TRAF6
in
precursor
cells
,
which
indicates
that
TRAF6
is
the
target
critical
for
the
IFN-gamma
action
.

Furthermore
,
we
provide
evidence
that
the
accelerated
degradation
of
TRAF6
requires
both
its
ubiquitination
,
which
is
initiated
by
RANKL
,
and
IFN-gamma
-induced
activation
of
the
ubiquitin-proteasome
system
.

Our
study
shows
that
there
is
cross-talk
between
the
tumour
necrosis
factor
and
IFN
families
of
cytokines
,
through
which
IFN-gamma
provides
a
negative
link
between
T-cell
activation
and
bone
resorption
.

Our
results
may
offer
a
therapeutic
approach
to
treat

Stromal-derived
factor
1
and
thrombopoietin
regulate
distinct
aspects
of
human
megakaryopoiesis
.

The
role
of
the
chemokine
binding
stromal-derived
factor
1
(
SDF-1
)
in
normal
human
megakaryopoiesis
at
the
cellular
and
molecular
levels
and
its
comparison
with
that
of
thrombopoietin
(
TPO
)
have
not
been
determined
.

In
this
study
it
was
found
that
SDF-1
,
unlike
TPO
,
does
not
stimulate
alpha

IIb
)
beta
(
3
)
(
+
)
cell
proliferation
or
differentiation
or
have
an
antiapoptotic
effect
.

However
,
it
does
induce
chemotaxis
,
trans-Matrigel
migration
,
and
secretion
of
matrix
metalloproteinase
9
(
MMP-9
)
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(
VEGF
)
by
these
cells
,
and
both
SDF-1
and
TPO
increase
the
adhesion
of
alpha
(
IIb
)
beta
(
3
)
(
+
)
cells
to
fibrinogen
and
vitronectin
.

Investigating
the
intracellular
signaling
pathways
induced
by
SDF-1
and
TPO
revealed
some
overlapping
patterns
of
protein
phosphorylation/activation
(
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
[
MAPK
]
p42/44
,
MAPK
p38
,
and
AKT
[
protein
kinase

]
)
and
some
that
were
distinct
for
TPO
(
eg
,
JAK-STAT
)
and
for
SDF-1
(
eg
,
NF-kappa
B
)
.

It
was
also
found
that
though
inhibition
of
phosphatidyl-inositol
3-kinase
(
PI-3K
)
by
LY294002
in
alpha
(
IIb
)
beta
(
3
)
(
+
)
cells
induced
apoptosis
and
inhibited
chemotaxis
adhesion
and
the
secretion
of
MMP-9
and
VEGF
,
the
inhibition
of
MAPK
p42/44
(
by
the
MEK
inhibitor
U0126
)
had
no
effect
on
the
survival
,
proliferation
,
and
migration
of
these
cells
.

Hence
,
it
is
suggested
that
the
proliferative
effect
of
TPO
is
more
related
to
activation
of
the
JAK-STAT
pathway
(
unique
to
TPO
)
,
and
the
PI-3K-AKT
axis
is
differentially
involved
in
TPO-
and
SDF-1-dependent
signaling
.

Accordingly
,
PI-3K
is
involved
in
TPO
-mediated
inhibition
of
apoptosis
,
TPO-
and
SDF-1-regulated
adhesion
to
fibrinogen
and
vitronectin
,
and
SDF-1
-mediated
migration
.

This
study
expands
the
understanding
of
the
role
of
SDF-1
and
TPO
in
normal
human
megakaryopoiesis
and
indicates
the
molecular
basis
of
the
observed
differences
in
cellular
responses

T

Among
them
,
thymic
epithelial
cells
(
TEC
)
are
known
to
exert
dominant
roles
in
their
survival
and
functional
shaping
.

Key
molecules
mediating

/
thymocytes
interactions
include
cytokines
and
growth
factors
secreted
by
the
two
cell
types
and
adhesion
receptors
mediating

.

Signaling
events
triggered
in
thymocytes
by
adhesion
to
epithelial
cells
have
been
extensively
investigated
,
whereas
little
is
known
on
the
opposite
phenomenon
.

We
have
previously
investigated
this
issue
in
a
co-culture
system
composed
of
TEC
cultures
derived
from
human
normal
thymus
and
heterologous
thymocytes
.

We
demonstrated
that
thymocytes
adhere
to
TEC
involving
beta1
and
beta4
integrins
and
induce
the
clustering
of
alpha3beta1
and
alpha6beta4
heterodimers
at
the
TEC
surface
.

In
addition
thymocyte
adhesion
was
followed
by
activation
of
NF-kappaB
and
NF-IL6
gene
transcription
factors
and
enhanced
IL-6
production
.

The
two
latter
phenomena
were
reproduced
by
the
cross-linking
of
the
alpha3
,
alpha6
,
beta1
and
beta4
integrins
,
thus
implying
that
the
alpha3beta1
and
alpha6beta4
heterodimers
can
signal
during
thymocyte
adhesion
.

We
have
extended
our
previous
work

in

experimental
setting
the

activity
of
non

of
the

We

up-regulated
the
nuclear

of

and
the

.

We
propose
that
alpha3beta1
and
alpha6beta4
heterodimers
are
induced
to
cluster
at
the
TEC
surface
recognizing

Identification
and
characterization
of
SKAT-2
,
a
novel
Th2-specific
zinc
finger
gene
.

We
have
identified
a
novel
Kruppel-type
zinc
finger
(
ZF
)
gene
,
SKAT-2
,
which
is
selectively
expressed
by
murine
Th2
cells
.

The
protein
encoded
by
this
gene
has
14
C2H2-type
ZF
tandemly
arrayed
at
its
C
terminus
and
N-terminal
SCAN
box
and
KRAB
domains
.

SKAT-2
is
tissue
restricted
in
expression
at
the
RNA
level
,
detectable
only
in
brain
and
at
low
levels
in
kidney
and
spleen
and
few
hematopoietic
cell
lines
.

By
in

hybridization
,
SKAT-2
expression
was
found
to
peak
in
antigen-stimulated
CD4
(
+
)
T
cells
after
2-3
days
of
culture
under
Th2
but
not
Th1
biasing
conditions
.

This
pattern
of
expression
closely
mirrored
that
of
GATA-3
in
the
same
cells
.

In
transient
transfection
experiments
in
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated
EL4
cells
,
SKAT-2
was
found
to
up-regulate
the
activity
of
the
IL-4
but
not
the
IL-5
promoter
,
contrasting
with
the
ability
of
GATA-3
to
activate
both
promoters
.

This
result
was
confirmed
using
clones
of
EL4
cells
stably
expressing
an
inducible
form
of
SKAT-2
,
thus
SKAT-2
is
a
novel
Th2-specific

that
may
play
a
role
in
selective

of

in

The
hsp70
co-chaperone
Hip
has
been
recovered
in
receptor.hsp90
heterocomplexes
at
an
intermediate
stage
of
assembly
in
reticulocyte
lysate
,
and
Hip
is
also
thought
to
be
an
intrinsic
component
of
the
assembly
machinery
.

Here
we
show
that
immunodepletion
of
Hip
from
reticulocyte
lysate
or
addition
of
high
levels
of
Hip
to
the
purified
five-protein
system
does
not
affect
GR.hsp90
heterocomplex
assembly
or
the
activation
of
steroid
binding
activity
that
occurs
with
assembly
.

Despite
the
fact
that
Hip
does
not
affect
assembly
,
it
is
recovered
in
GR.hsp90
heterocomplexes
assembled
by
both
systems
.

In
the
five-protein
system
,
Hip
prevents
inhibition
of
assembly
by
the
hsp70
co-chaperone
BAG-1
,
and
cotransfection
of
Hip
with
BAG-1
opposes
BAG-1
reduction
of
steroid
binding
activity
in
COS
cells
.

We
conclude
that
Hip
is
not
a
component
of
the
assembly
machinery
but
that
it
could
play
a
regulatory
role
in
opposition
to
BAG-1

Cutting
edge
:
STAT6-deficient
mice
have
enhanced
tumor
immunity
to
primary
and
metastatic
mammary
carcinoma
.

STAT4
and
STAT6
are
essential
for
the
development
of
CD4
(
+
)
Th1
and
Th2
development
,
respectively
.

Tumor
immunologists
have
hypothesized
that
Th1
cells
are
critical
in
tumor
immunity
because
they
facilitate
differentiation
of
CD8
(
+
)
T
cells
,
which
are
potent
anti-tumor
effectors
.

We
have
used
STAT4
(
-/-
)
and
STAT6
(
-/-
)
mice
to
test
this
hypothesis
.

BALB/c
and
knockout
mice
were
challenged
in
the
mammary
gland
with
the
highly
malignant
and
spontaneously
metastatic
BALB/c-derived
4T1
mammary
carcinoma
.

Primary
tumor
growth
and
metastatic
disease
are
reduced
in
STAT6
(
-/-
)
mice
relative
to
BALB/c
and
STAT4
(
-/-
)
mice
.

Ab
depletions
demonstrate
that
the
effect
is
mediated
by
CD8
(
+
)
T
cells
,
and
immunized
STAT6
(
-/-
)
mice
have
higher
levels
of
4T1-specific
CTL
than
BALB/c
or
STAT4
(
-/-
)
mice
.

Surprisingly
,
Th1
or
Th2
cells
are
not
involved
,
because
CD4
depletion
does
not
diminish
the
anti-tumor
effect
.

Therefore
,
deletion
of
the
STAT6
gene
facilitates
development
of
potent
anti-tumor
immunity
via
a
CD4
(
+
)
-independent
pathway
.

Activation

We
previously

as
c-Jun

In

,
we
have
examined
the
ability
of
Tax
to
activate
transcription
through
the
AP-1-binding
site
(
AP-1

)
.

A
transient
transfection
study
showed
that
Tax
can
activate
transcription
through
the
AP-1-binding
site
in
a
human
T
cell
line
,
whereas
any
combination
of
AP-1
proteins
did
so
much
less
than
Tax
,
indicating
that
the
activation
of
the
AP-1
site
by
Tax
may
require
a
mechanism
other
than
the
induction
of
AP-1
mRNA
.

Fresh
peripheral
blood
leukemia
cells
of
all
surveyed
ATL
patients
displayed
constitutive
AP-1
DNA-binding
activity
,
whereas
no
normal

did

However
,
the
HTLV-1
genes
,
including
tax
,
are
not
significantly
expressed
in
fresh
leukemia
cells
from
ATL
patients
.

Our
present
results
suggest
that
activation
of
AP-1
occurs
through
Tax-dependent
and
-independent
mechanisms
in
HTLV-1-infected
T

which
may
play
some

Continuous

were
cultured
in
IL-3
,
higher
levels
of
these
adhesion
molecules
were
detected
.

Expression
of
activated
Raf
oncoproteins
also
abrogated
cytokine
dependency
and
prevented
apoptosis
of
TF-1
cells
.

Moreover
,
the
differentiation
status
of
these
Raf-responsive
cells
was
more
immature
upon
Raf
activation
as
culture
with
the
differentiation-inducing
agent
phorbol
12
myristate
13-acetate
(
PMA
)
and
beta-estradiol
resulted
in
decreased
levels
of
the
CD11b
and
CD18
integrin
molecules
on
the
cell
surface
.

In
contrast
when
the
Raf-responsive
cells
were
induced
to
differentiate
with
PMA
and
GM-CSF
,
in
the
absence
of
deltaRaf
:
ER
activation
,
increased
levels
of
the
CD11b
and
CD18
molecules
were
detected
.

Retinoic
acid
(
RA
)
inhibited
3H-thymidine
incorporation
in
response
to
GM-CSF
.

Interestingly
,
Raf
activation
counterbalanced
the
inhibition
of
DNA
synthesis
caused
by
RA
but
not
PMA
.

Thus
deregulated
Raf
expression
can
alter
cytokine
dependency
,
integrin
expression
and
the
stage
of
differentiation
.

These
Raf-responsive
cell
lines
will
be
useful
in
elucidating
the
roles
of
the
MAP
kinase
cascade
on
hematopoietic
cell
differentiation
and
malignant
transformation

Cyclic
AMP
activates
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
in
Th2
cells
:
phosphorylation
of
GATA-3
and
stimulation
of
Th2
cytokine
gene
expression
.

cAMP
is
an
important
second
messenger
with
immunomodulatory
properties
.

Elevation
of
intracellular
cAMP
in
T
cells
,
induced
by
agents
such
as
IL-1alpha
or
PGs
,
inhibits
T
cell
activation
.

In
effector
T
cells
,
an
increase
in
the
level
of
intracellular
cAMP
inhibits
cytokine
production
in
Th1
cells
but
stimulates
cytokine
production
in
Th2
cells
.

Here
we
report
that
cAMP-induced
effects
in
Th2
cells
occur
independently
of
the
protein
kinase
A
pathway
,
which
is
the
major
mediator
of
cAMP-induced
signaling
events
in
most
cell
types
.

Instead
,
cAMP
stimulates
activation
of
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
in
Th2
cells
.

This
appears
to
be
a
Th2
-selective
event
because
cAMP
barely
increased
p38
phosphorylation
in
Th1
cells
.

We
show
that
in
Th2
cells
,
cAMP
promotes
the
production
of
both
IL-5
and
IL-13
,
which
play
distinct
but
critical
roles
in
asthma
pathogenesis
.

Our
data
also
show
that
cAMP
causes
increased
phosphorylation
of
the
transcription
factor
GATA-3
,
which
we
have
shown
is
a
critical
regulator
of
Th2
cytokine
gene
expression
and
,
in
turn
,
of
airway
inflammation
in
mice
.

Thus
,
Th2
-specific
GATA-3
expression
and
p38
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
activation
together
provide
a
molecular
basis
for
the
differential
effects
of
cAMP
in
the
two
T
helper
cell
subsets
.

Characterization
of
IL-4
and
IL-13
signals
dependent
on
the
human
IL-13
receptor
alpha
chain
1
:
redundancy
of
requirement
of
tyrosine
residue
for
STAT3
activation
.

IL-4
and
IL-13
are
pleiotropic
cytokines
whose
biological
activities
overlap
with
each
other
.

IL-13
receptor
alpha
chain
1
(
IL-13R
alpha
1
)
is
necessary
for
binding
to
IL-13
,
and
the
heterodimer
composed
of
IL-13R
alpha
1
and
IL-4R
alpha
chain
transduces
IL-13
and
IL-4
signals
;
however
,
the
functional
mapping
of
the
intracellular
domain
of
IL-13R
alpha
1
is
not
fully
understood
.

In
this
study
,
we
constructed
wild
and
mutated
types
of
human
IL-13R
alpha
1
,
and
analyzed
IL-4
and
IL-13
signals
using
an
IL-13R
alpha
1
-transfected
human
B
cell
line
.

Expression
of
IL-13R
alpha
1
evoked
STAT3
activation
by
IL-4
and
IL-13
,
and
in
stimulated
human
B
cells
,
on
which
IL-13R
alpha
1
was
highly
expressed
,
IL-4
and
IL-13
induced
STAT3
activation
.

Replacement
of
the
two
tyrosine
residues
completely
abolished
STAT3
activation
,
although
replacing
either
tyrosine
residue
alone
retained
it
.

Furthermore
,
we
found
that
the
Box1
region
and
the
C-terminal
tail
of
IL-13R
alpha
1
were
critical
for
binding
to
Tyk2
,
and
activation
of
Jak1
,
Tyk2
,
the
insulin
receptor
substrate-1
and
STAT6
respectively
.

These
results
suggest
that
STAT3
activation
is
involved
with
IL-4
and
IL-13
signals
in
human
B
cells
along
with
the
activation
of
STAT6
,
and
that
there
is
a
unique
sequence
in
IL-13R
alpha
1
to
activate
STAT3
.

Functional
uncoupling
of
the
Janus
kinase
3-Stat5
pathway
in
malignant
growth
of
human
T
cell
leukemia
virus
type
1-transformed
human
T
cells
.

Human
T
cell
leukemia
virus
type
1
(
HTLV-1
)
transforms
cytokine
-dependent
T
lymphocytes
and
causes
adult
T
cell
leukemia
.

Janus
tyrosine
kinase
(
Jak
)
3
and
transcription
factors
Stat5a
and
Stat5b
are
essential
for
the
proliferation
of
normal
T
cells
and
are
constitutively
hyperactivated
in
both
HTLV-1-transformed
human
T
cell
lines
and
lymphocytes
isolated
from
HTLV-1-infected
patients
;
therefore
,
a
critical
role
for
the
Jak3-Stat5
pathway
in
the
progression
of
this
disease
has
been
postulated
.

We
recently
reported
that
tyrphostin
AG-490
selectively
blocked
IL-2
activation
of
Jak3/Stat5
and
growth
of
murine
T
cell
lines
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
disruption
of
Jak3/Stat5a/b
signaling
with
AG-490
(
50
&
mgr
;
M
)
blocked
the
proliferation
of
primary
human
T
lymphocytes
,
but
paradoxically
failed
to
inhibit
the
proliferation
of
HTLV-1-transformed
human
T
cell
lines
,
HuT-102
and
MT-2
.

Structural
homologues
of
AG-490
also
inhibited
the
proliferation
of
primary
human
T
cells
,
but
not
HTLV-1-infected
cells
.

Disruption
of
constitutive
Jak3/Stat5
activation
by
AG-490
was
demonstrated
by
inhibition
of
1
)
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
Jak3
,
Stat5a
(
Tyr
(
694
)
)
,
and
Stat5b
(
Tyr
(
699
)
)
;

)
serine
phosphorylation
of
Stat5a
(
Ser
(
726
)
)
as
determined
by
a
novel
phosphospecific
Ab
;
and
3
)
Stat5a/b
DNA
binding
to
the
Stat5-responsive
beta-casein
promoter
.

In
contrast
,
AG-490
had
no
effect
on
DNA
binding
by
p50/p65
components
of
NF-kappaB
,
a
transcription
factor
activated
by
the
HTLV-1-encoded
phosphoprotein
,
Tax
.

Collectively
,
these
data
suggest
that
the
Jak3-Stat5
pathway
in
HTLV-1-transformed
T
cells
has
become
functionally
redundant
for
proliferation
.

Reversal
of
this
functional
uncoupling
may
be
required
before
Jak3/Stat5
inhibitors
will
be
useful
in
the
treatment
of
this
malignancy
.

The
Epstein-Barr
virus
promoter
initiating
B-cell
transformation
is
activated
by
RFX
proteins
and
the
B-cell-specific
activator
protein
BSAP/Pax5
.

Epstein-Barr
virus
(
EBV
)
-induced
B-cell
growth
transformation
,
a
central
feature
of
the
virus
'
strategy
for
colonizing
the
human
B-cell
system
,
requires
full
virus
latent
gene
expression
and
is
initiated
by
transcription
from
the
viral
promoter
Wp
.

Interestingly
,
when
EBV
accesses
other
cell
types
,
this
growth-transforming
program
is
not
activated
.

The
present
work
focuses
on
a
region
of
Wp
which
in
reporter
assays
confers
B-cell
-specific
activity
.

Bandshift
studies
indicate
that
this
region
contains
three
factor
binding
sites
,
termed
sites
B
,
C
,
and
D
,
in
addition
to
a
previously
characterized
CREB
site
.

Here
we
show
that
site
C
binds
members
of
the
ubiquitously
expressed
RFX
family
of
proteins
,
notably
RFX1
,
RFX3
,
and
the
associated
factor
MIBP1
,
whereas
sites
B
and
D
both
bind
the
B-cell-specific
activator
protein
BSAP/Pax5
.

In
reporter
assays
with
mutant
Wp
constructs
,
the
loss
of
factor
binding
to
any
one
of
these
sites
severely
impaired
promoter
activity
in
B
cells
,
while
the
wild-type
promoter
could
be
activated
in
non-B
cells
by
ectopic
BSAP
expression
.

We
suggest
that
Wp
regulation
by
BSAP
helps
to
ensure
the
B-cell
specificity
of
EBV
's
growth-transforming
function
.

Activation
of
the
Lck
tyrosine
protein
kinase
by
the
Herpesvirus
saimiri
tip
protein
involves
two
binding
interactions
.

The
Tip
protein
of
Herpesvirus
saimiri
strain
484C
binds
to
and
activates
the
Lck
tyrosine
protein
kinase
.

Two
sequences
in
the
Tip
protein
were
previously
shown
to
be
involved
in
binding
to
Lck
.

A
proline-rich
region
,
residues
132-141
,
binds
to
the
SH3
domain
of
the
Lck
protein
.

We
show
here
that
the
other
Lck-binding
domain
,
residues
104-113
,
binds
to
the
carboxyl-terminal
half
of
Lck
and
that
this
binding
does
not
require
the
Lck
SH3
domain
.

Mutated
Tip
containing
only
one
functional
Lck-binding
domain
can
bind
stably
to
Lck
,
although
not
as
strongly
as
wild-type
Tip
.

Interaction
of
Tip
with
Lck
through
either
Lck-binding
domain
increases
the
activity
of
Lck
in
vivo
.

Simultaneous
binding
of
both
domains
is
required
for
maximal
activation
of
Lck
.

The
transient
expression
of
Tip
in
T
cells
was
found
to
stimulate
both
Stat3
-dependent
and
NF-AT
-dependent
transcription
.

Mutant
forms
of
Tip
lacking
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
Lck-binding
domains
retained
the
ability
to
stimulate
Stat3
-dependent
transcription
.

Tip
lacking
the
proline-rich
Lck-binding
domain
exhibited
almost
wild-type
activity
in
this
assay
.

In
contrast
,
ablation
of
either
Lck-binding
domain
abolished
the
ability
of
Tip
to
stimulate
NF-AT
-dependent
transcription
.

Full
biological
activity
of
Tip
,
therefore
,
appears
to
require
both
Lck-binding
domains
.

Accumulation
of
RXR
alpha
during
activation
of
cycling
human
T
lymphocytes
:
modulation
of
RXRE
transactivation
function
by
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
pathways
.

We
have
previously
reported
that
the
activation
of
resting
human
immature
peripheral
blood
T
(
PBT
)
lymphocytes
is
associated
with
the
loss
of
retinoid
X
receptor
alpha
(
RXRalpha
)
expression
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
have
demonstrated
that
,
unlike
resting
cells
,
activation
of
cycling
human
mature
PBT
lymphocytes
,
and
T
lymphocyte
leukemia
cell
lines
is
accompanied
by
the
accumulation
of
RXRalpha
mRNA
and
protein
.

Interestingly
,
cyclosporin
A
further
augmented
RXRalpha
expression
,
indicating
the
involvement
of
calcineurin
pathways
in
the
process
.

9-cis
retinoic
acid
inhibited
the
accumulation
,
suggesting
that
retinoids
can
regulate
the
synthesis
of
their
own
receptors
during
T
cell
activation
.

Transfection
analysis
in
Jurkat
cells
,
using
RXRE-dependent
reporter
assays
,
showed
that
RXRalpha
accumulated
during
T
cell
activation
was
transcriptionally
inactive
.

To
investigate
the
mechanism
of
such
inhibition
,
the
role
of
two
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
pathways
,
c-Jun
N-terminal
kinase
(
JNK
)
and
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase
(
ERK
)
,
in
modulating
RXRE-dependent
transcription
,
was
explored
.

The
expression
of
constitutively
active
MAP/ERK
kinase
kinase
1
(
MEKK1
)
inhibited
RXRE-dependent
transcription
,
whereas
dominant
negative
MEKK1
increased
the
transcription
,
indicating
the
involvement
of
JNK
signaling
pathways
in
the
process
.

In
contrast
,
expression
of
constitutively
active
MEK1
,
which
activates
ERK
pathway
,
enhanced
RXRE-dependent
activation
.

When
both
were
activated
simultaneously
,
JNK
pathway
was
dominant
over
ERK
pathway
and
resulted
in
inhibition
of
RXRE-mediated
transcription
.

These
data
demonstrate
a
dual
regulatory
control
of
RXRalpha
expression
during
the
activation
of
resting
and
cycling
T
lymphocytes
and
indicate
a
dynamic
balance
between
JNK
and
ERK
pathways
in
modulating
RXRE-mediated
transactivation
.

The
proteasome
regulates
receptor-mediated
endocytosis
of
interleukin-2
.

Recent
studies
have
increasingly
implicated
the
proteasome
in
the
regulation
of
cell
surface
receptors
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
the
proteasome
for
ligand-dependent
endocytosis
and
degradation
of
the
interleukin-2
(
IL-2
)
-interleukin-2
receptor
(
IL-2R
)
complex
.

Proteasome
inhibitors
impaired
internalization
of
IL-2.IL-2R
and
prevented
the
lysosomal
degradation
of
this
cytokine
.

Based
on
time-course
studies
,
proteasome
activity
is
primarily
required
after
initial
endocytosis
of
the
IL-2.IL-2R
.

Proteasome
function
was
also
necessary
for
the
lysosomal
degradation
of
IL-2
internalized
by
IL-2R
that
were
comprised
of
cytoplasmic
tailless
beta-
or
gamma
c-subunits
,
suggesting
that
the
target
protein
for
the
proteasome
is
independent
of
either
the
cytoplasmic
tail
of
the
IL-2R
beta-
or
gamma
c-subunits
and
their
associated
signaling
components
.

Therefore
,
a
functional
proteasome
is
required
for
optimal
endocytosis
of
the
IL-2R/ligand
complex
and
is
essential
for
the
subsequent
lysosomal
degradation
of
IL-2
,
possibly
by
regulating
trafficking
to
the
lysosome
.

Functional
characterization
of
the
two
alternative
promoters
of
human
p45
NF-E2
gene
.

OBJECTIVE
:
The
transcription
factor
NF-E2
,
a
heterodimeric
protein
complex
composed
of
p45
and
small
Maf
family
proteins
,
is
considered
crucial
for
the
proper
differentiation
of
erythrocytes
and
megakaryocytes
in
vivo
.

We
report
the
results
of
studies
aimed
at
understanding
the
regulatory
mechanisms
controlling
p45
gene
expression
in
erythroid
cells
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
Human
p45
mRNAs
have
two
alternative
isoforms
,
aNF-E2
and
fNF-E2
,
and
these
isoforms
are
transcribed
from
the
alternative
promoters
.

We
investigated
lineage-specific
expression
of
both
isomers
in
human
erythroid
and
megakaryocytic
cells
by
reverse
transcriptase
polymerase
chain
reaction
or
Northern
blot
analysis
.

For
functional
characterization
of
both
promoters
,
plasmids
in
which
reporter
genes
were
placed
under
the
control
of
a
series
of
truncated
or
mutated
promoter
fragments
were
transfected
to
human
hematopoietic
cell
lines
.

RESULTS
:
When
CD34
(
+
)
cells
isolated
from
human
cord
blood
were
induced
to
unilineage
erythroid
or
megakaryocytic
differentiation
in
liquid
suspension
culture
,
both
transcripts
,
although
barely
detected
at
day
0
,
were
induced
in
both
erythroid
and
megakaryocytic
cultures
.

fNF-E2
mRNA
was
found
to
be
more
abundant
in
erythroid
cells
than
megakaryocytic
cells
at
day
7
of
culture
.

Although
both
isomers
were
expressed
in
human
erythroid-megakaryocytic
cell
lines
,
megakaryocytic
maturation
with
loss
of
erythroid
phenotype
induced
by
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
(
PMA
)
resulted
in
exclusive
downregulation
of
fNF-E2
,
suggesting
that
fNF-E2
promoter
is
more
erythroid
specific
.

Functional
analysis
of
fNF-E2
promoter
showed
that
the
promoter
is
active
only
in
erythroid-megakaryocytic
cells
and
that
the
double
GATA
sit
e
in
the
proximal
region
is
necessary
for
its
efficient
activity
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
results
suggest
that
GATA
proteins
,
which
govern
the
differentiation
of
erythroid
lineage
cells
,
are
required
for
full
promoter
activity
of
the
p45
gene
.

Transcriptional
activation
of
heme
oxygenase-1
and
its
functional
significance
in
acetaminophen-induced
hepatitis
and
hepatocellular
injury
in
the
rat
.

BACKGROUND/AIM
:
Glutathione
depletion
contributes
to
acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity
and
is
known
to
induce
the
oxidative
stress
reactant
heme
oxygenase-1
.

The
metabolites
of
the
heme
oxygenase
pathway
,
biliverdin
,
carbon
monoxide
,
and
iron
may
modulate
acetaminophen
toxicity
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
assess
cell-type
specific
expression
of
heme
oxygenase-1
and
its
impact
on
liver
injury
and
microcirculatory
disturbances
in
a
model
of
acetaminophen-induced
hepatitis
.

METHODS
:
Gene
expression
of
heme
oxygenase-1
was
studied
by
Northern-
and
Western
analysis
as
well
as
immunohistochemistry
.

The
time
course
of
heme
oxygenase-1
and
-2
,
cytokine-induced
neutrophil

,
and
intercellular

was
studied
by

.

DNA-binding

of

was
determined
by
electrophoretic

.

Sinusoidal

and
leukocyte-endothelial
interactions
were
assessed
by
intravital

.

RESULTS
:
Acetaminophen
caused
a

with

of

factor-kappaB
and
intercellular
adhesion

and
cytokine-induced
neutrophil
chemoattractant-1
mRNAs
.

Induction
of
heme
oxygenase-1
mRNA
and
protein
(
approximately
30-fold
)
in

the
inflammatory
response
.

Blockade
of

abrogated
acetaminophen-induced
hepatic
neutrophil
accumulation
and
nuclear
factor-kappaB
activation
,
but
failed
to
affect
sinusoidal
perfusion
and
liver
injury
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
inflammatory
response
associated
with
acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity
is
modulated
by
the
parallel
induction
of
the
heme
oxygenase-1
gene
.

However
,
heme
oxygenase-1
has
no
permissive
effect
on
sinusoidal
perfusion
and
does
not
affect
liver
injury
in
this
model
.

These
data
argue
against
a
central
role
of
nuclear
factor-kappaB
activation
and
neutrophil
infiltration
as
perpetuating
factors
of
liver
injury
in
acetaminophen
toxicity
.

Tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
-induced
proliferation
requires
synthesis
of
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
.

OBJECTIVE
:
Tumor
necrosis
factor-
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
induces
a
variety
of
cellular
responses
,
some
of
them
being
at
least
seemingly
contradictory
.

Thus
,
we
set
out
to
find
differences
in
the
modes
of
proliferative
and
apoptotic
responses
to
TNF-
alpha
.

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
We
screened
a
panel
of
acute
myeloid
leukemia-derived
cell
lines
for
TNF-
alpha
-responsiveness
.

In
two
lines
(
OCI-AML-1
,
OCI-AML-11
)
,
TNF-
alpha
acted
as
an
apoptotic
agent
;
in
others
(
HU-3
,
M-07e
,
TF-1
)
,
it
had
the
opposite
effect
,
preventing
apoptosis
and
inducing
proliferation
.

Direct
and
indirect
signaling
mechanisms
,
including
NF-kappaB
activation
and
cytokine
synthesis
,
were
analyzed
.

RESULTS
:
All
cell
lines
tested
expressed
TNF-
alpha
receptors
I
and
II
and
responded
to
TNF-
alpha
by
upregulation
of
intercellular
adhesion
molecule-1
.

In
contrast
to
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
,
TNF-
alpha
did
not
activate
the
MAP
kinase
and
p70S6
kinase
pathways
.

Nevertheless
,
inhibitors
of
these
pathways
clearly
reduced
the
TNF-alpha
-induced
cell
growth
,
indicating
that
TNF-
alpha-proliferative
cells
produced
a
growth
factor
that
induced
proliferation
upon
stimulation
of
the
above
pathways
.

Anti-GM-CSF
antibodies
inhibited
the
TNF-alpha
-induced
growth
,
suggesting
the
presence
of
an
autocrine
loop
for
cell
proliferation
mediated
by
GM-CSF
.

Supporting
this
notion
,
TNF-alpha
-induced
upregulation
of
GM-CSF
mRNA
levels
and
protein
secretion
in
the
TNF-alpha
-proliferative
,
but
not
in
the
TNF-alpha-apoptotic
cell
lines
.

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
identify
GM-CSF
synthesis
as
an
early
and
essential
step
in
TNF-
alpha-induced
proliferation
.

We
show
for
the
first
time
that
TNF-alpha-treated
cell
lines
producing
no
or
only
minimal
amounts
of
GM-CSF
demonstrate
an
apoptotic
phenotype
,
while
cell
lines
with
high
GM-CSF
expression
rates
can
escape
from
growth
arrest
or
even
apoptosis
.

In
this
context
,
we
discuss
arguments
pointing
at
NF-kappaB
as
regulator
of
GM-CSF
synthesis
and
thus
indirectly
as
regulator
for
the
escape
of
TNF-alpha
-induced
apoptosis

Glucocorticoid
receptor
content
of
T
lymphocytes
:
evidence
for
heterogeneity
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
were
measured
in
T
lymphocytes
that
were
isolated
from
peripheral
blood
by
either
nylon
wool
filtration
or
E-rosette
sedimentation
.

T
cells
isolated
by
nylon
wool
filtration
specifically
bind
6.7
+/-
0.2
fmol
of
dexamethasone
per
million
cells
(
equivalent
to
4000
+/-
200
receptors
per
cell
)
,
whereas
T
cells
isolated
by
E-rosette
sedimentation
bind
12.0
+/-
0.7
fmol
of
dexamethasone
per
million
cells
(
equivalent
to
7200
+/-
400
receptors
per
cell
)
.

This
difference
in
the
amount
of
dexamethasone
bound
by
the
two
T
cell
preparations
was
significant
(
p
less
than
.001
)
and
was
present
immediately
after
cell
isolation
.

The
binding
affinities
of
the
different
T
cell
preparations
for
dexamethasone
were
similar
.

T
cells
that
are
isolated
by
a
combination
of
nylon
wool
filtration
followed
by
E-rosette
sedimentation
bind
the
same
amount
of
dexamethasone
as
T
cells
isolated
by
nylon
wool
filtration
alone
.

T
cells
isolated
by
a
combination
of
E-rosette
sedimentation
following
by
nylon
wool
filtration
bind
less
dexamethasone
than
do
T
cells
isolated
by
E-rosette
sedimentation
alone
.

These
findings
suggest
that
T
cells
are
heterogeneous
with
respect
to
their
quantity
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

Isolation
of
T
cells
by
E-rosette
sedimentation
enriches
for
T
cells
that
have
a
greater
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
,
and
isolation
of
T
cells
by
nylon
wool
filtration
enriches
for
T
cells
that
have
a
lesser
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
and
glucocorticoid
sensitivity
of
human
leukemic
cells
.

We
have
established
optimal
conditions
for
the
measurement
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
in
human
white
cells
using
a
whole-cell
binding
assay
with
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
as
the
ligand
,
and
the
subsequent
determination
of
the
GR
content
in
normal
human
lymphocytes
and
in
leukemic
cells
of
patients
with
various
forms
of
acute
and
chronic
leukemia
.

A
number
of
leukemia
cell
lines
in
continuous
culture
were
also
subjected
to
the
GR
assay
,
and
the
results
were
correlated
with
the
sensitivity
of
these
cell
lines
to
glucocorticoid
steroids
in
vitro
.

The
GR
content
of
normal
human
lymphocytes
amounted
to
4
,
850
+/-
1
,
340
(
mean
+/-
SD
)
receptors/cell
.

The
mean
equilibrium
dissociation
constant
(
KD
)
of
the
interaction
of
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
with
the
GR
was
1.2
x
10
(
-8
)
M
.

Steroidal
compounds
with
a
known
glucocorticoid
potency
effectively
competed
for
the
binding
,
whereas
steroids
devoid
of
glucocorticoid
activity
(
e.g.
estradiol-17
beta
and
testosterone
)
were
ineffective
.

The
GR
content
of
the
blast
cells
obtained
from
eight
patients
suffering
from
acute
leukemia
and
four
patients
with
a
blast
crisis
of
chronic
myelocytic
leukemia
was
found
to
be
highly
variable
(
3
,
230-29
,
900
receptors/cell
)
,
while
the
lymphocytes
of
six
patients
with
chronic
lymphatic
leukemia
contained
a
rather
stable
GR
content
(
2
,
930-5
,
120
receptors/cell
)
,
which
was
comparable
with
that
of
normal
lymphocytes
.

GR
was
identified
in
all
the
12
malignant
continuous
white
cell
lines
studied
.

Large
cells
contained
more
GR
than
the
smaller
ones
.

There
was
no
apparent
correlation
between
the
GR
concentration
and
the
sensitivity
of
the
cells
in
vitro
to
glucocorticoids
as
judged
by
[
3H
]
thymidine
incorporation
studies
.

Distribution
of
the
surface
markers
in
the
leukemic
cell
lines
did
not
relate
to
the
GR
concentration
.

We
conclude
that
the
presence
of
GR
is
probably
a
universal
feature
of
the
leukemic
cells
,
and
,
from
a
clinical
standpoint
,
probably
does
not
alone
imply
steroid
responsiveness
.

Evidence
for
a
steroid
receptor
in
rheumatoid
synovial
tissue
cells
.

One
mechanism
by
which
glucocorticoids
could
exert
their
anti-inflammatory
action
is
via
rapidly
saturable
,
stereo-specific
cytoplasmic
protein
receptors
.

This
report
is
of
an
investigation
into
such
a
possibility
in
synovial
cells
.

Synovium
,
obtained
from
knee
joints
of
rheumatoid
patients
undergoing
surgery
,
was
incubated
with
clostridiopeptidase
A
and
trypsin-EDTA
to
obtain
cell
suspensions
.

These
,
together
with
cells
obtained
from
synovial
fluid
aspirated
from
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
were
identified
by
electron
microscopy
.

Duplicate
samples
of
these
cell
suspensions
were
incubated
with
increasing
concentrations
of
H3Dexamethasone
(
1
x
10
(
-10
)
M-1
x
10
(
-9
)
M
)
for
30
minutes
at
37
degrees
C
.

Analysis
of
the
proportion
of
steroid
bound
to
whole
cells
showed
evidence
for
specific
,
rapidly
saturable
,
receptors
in
the
cells
obtained
from
synovial
tissue
,
but
this
was
not
found
in
synovial
fluid
cells
.

Electron
micrographs
showed
that
cells
obtained
from
synovial
tissue
consisted
of
synovial
fibroblast
-
and
macrophage-types
,
lymphocytes
,
monocytes
and
macrophages
.

Polymorphonuclear
leucocytes
appeared
to
be
absent
.

However
,
in
synovial
fluid
cell
type
polymorphonuclear
leucocytes
were
the
predominant
cell
type
.

We
concluded
from
this
,
that
one
or
more
of
the
cell
types
present
in
synovial
tissue
contain
a
specific
steroid
receptor
,
but
that
this
is
lacking
in
synovial
fluid
polymorphonuclear
leucocytes
.

Clinical
implications
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
human
leukemia
.

Glucorticoid
receptors
were
studied
in
various
populations
of
normal
human
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
and
leukemic
lymphoblasts
.

Normal
lymphocytes
contain
low
levels
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
approximately
2
,
500
sites/cell
)
which
are
identical
in
T-
and
non-T-fractions
.

Phytohemagglutinin
treatment
increases
levels
about
3-fold
.

Leukemic
lymphoblasts
contain
larger
numbers
of
receptor
sites
.

Presence
of
receptor
is
correlated
with
in
vitro
sensitivitiy
to
glucocorticoids
and
in
vivo
response
to
therapy
.

Quantity
of
receptor
is
also
correlated
with
complete
remission
duration
independently
of
leukemic
cell
type
(
T
or
null
)
,
initial
WBC
,
or
age
of
patient
.

Quantitative
determination
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
in
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
may
be
of
value
both
as
an
independent
prognostic
variable
and
in
suggesting
which
patients
should
receive
glucocorticoid
therapy
.

Functional
and
physical
interaction
of
protein-tyrosine
kinases
Fyn
and
Csk
in
the
T-cell
signaling
system
.

The
Src-like
protein-tyrosine
kinase
Fyn
is
associated
with
T-cell
antigen
receptor
.

Transient
expression
of
actively
mutated
Fyn
,
having
Phe-528
instead
of
Tyr-528
or
Thr-338
instead
of
Ile-338
,
in
Jurkat
T-cells
stimulated
the
serum
response
element
(
SRE
)
,
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate
response
element
,
cyclic
AMP
response
element
,
and
c-fos
promoter
.

The
stimulation
of
SRE
was
particularly
prominent
not
only
with
active
Fyn
but
also
with
normal
(
wild-type
)
Fyn
.

SRE
was
also
stimulated
by
both
normal
and
active
Lck
.

Furthermore
,
normal
and
active
Fyn
stimulated
transcription
from
the
IL-2
gene
promoter
when
transfected
cells
were
stimulated
by
concanavalin
A
plus
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
.

Under
the
same
conditions
,
Lck
did
not
stimulate
IL-2
promoter
unless
it
was
activated
by
mutation
.

Interestingly
,
a
mutant
Fyn
,
which
has
deletions
within
the
SH2
region
and
so
is
able
to
transform
chicken
embryo
fibroblasts
,
did
not
stimulate
either
the
c-fos
or
IL-2
promoter
,
suggesting
the
importance
of
this
region
in
T-cell
signaling
.

Csk
,
which
phosphorylates
tyrosine
residues
in
the
negative
regulatory
sites
of
Src
family
kinases
,
down-regulated
Fyn-
and
Lck-mediated
stimulation
of
the
serum
response
element
and
Fyn-mediated
enhancement
of
IL-2
promoter
activity
.

These
data
suggest
that
Fyn
and
Lck
,
whose
activities
are
regulated
by
Csk
,
are
involved
in
different
phases
of
T-cell
activation
.

A
novel
NF-kappa
B
complex
containing
p65
homodimers
:
implications
for
transcriptional
control
at
the
level
of
subunit
dimerization
.

The
predominant
inducible
form
of
the
NF-kappa
B
transcription
factor
is
a
heteromeric
complex
containing
two
Rel-related
DNA-binding
subunits
,
termed
p65
and
p50
.

Prior
transfection
studies
have
shown
that
when
these
p65
and
p50
subunits
are
expressed
independently
as
stable
homodimers
,
p65
stimulates
kappa
B-directed
transcription
,
whereas
p50
functions
as
a
kappa
B-specific
repressor
.

While
authentic
p50
homodimers
(
previously
termed
KBF1
)
have
been
detected
in
nuclear
extracts
from
nontransfected
cells
,
experimental
evidence
supporting
the
existence
of
p65
homodimers
in
vivo
was
lacking
.

We
now
provide
direct
biochemical
evidence
for
the
presence
of
an
endogenous
pool
of
inducible
p65
homodimers
in
intact
human
T
cells
.

As
with
the
prototypical
NF-kappa
B
p50-p65
heterodimer
,
this
novel
p65
homodimeric
form
of
NF-kappa
B
is
functionally
sequestered
in
the
cytoplasm
but
rapidly
appears
in
the
nuclear
compartment
following
cellular
stimulation
.

Site-directed
mutagenesis
studies
indicate
that
the
homodimerization
function
of
p65
is
dependent
upon
the
presence
of
cysteine
216
and
a
conserved
recognition
motif
for
protein
kinase
A
(
RRPS
;
amino
acids
273
to
276
)
,
both
of
which
reside
within
a
91-amino-acid
segment
of
the
Rel
homology
domain
that
mediates
self-association
.

In
contrast
,
mutations
at
these
two
sites
do
not
affect
heterodimerization
of
p65
with
p50
or
its
functional
interaction
with
I
kappa
B
alpha
.

These
later
findings
indicate
that
neither
homo-
nor
heterodimer
formation
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
for
I
kappa
B
alpha
recognition
of
p65
.

Taken
together
with
prior
in
vivo
transcription
studies
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
biological
activities
of
p65
and
p50
homodimers
are
independently
regulated
,
thereby
providing
an
integrated
and
flexible
control
mechanism
for
the
rapid
activation
and
repression
of
NF-kappa
B
/
Rel
-directed
gene
expression
.

Carrier
determination
for
X-linked
agammaglobulinemia
using
X
inactivation
analysis
of
purified
B
cells
.

We
report
the
development
of
a
relatively
quick
and
simple
method
for
the
assessment
of
X
inactivation
status
for
carrier
determination
in
families
affected
by
X-linked
agammaglobulinemia
(
XLA
)
.

This
method
utilises
an
immunomagnetic
separation
technique
for
B
cell
purification
and
a
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
based
assay
for
the
determination
of
methylation
status
at
the
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
gene
locus
to
assess
whether
X
inactivation
is
random
or
non-random
at
this
locus
.

We
report
the
results
we
have
obtained
using
this
assay
to
investigate
females
known
to
be
carriers
of
various
X-linked
immunodeficiency
disorders
.

In
addition
,
we
investigated
four
females
from
different
families
affected
by
XLA
,
two
of
whom
were
of
unknown
carrier
status
,
and
we
discuss
the
results
obtained
with
this
and
other
X-inactivation
assays
.

A
similar
assay
has
recently
been
described
by
Allen
et
al.
(
1992
)
and
applied
to
members
of
one
family
affected
by
XLA
.

Effects
of
IL-4
and
Fc
gamma
receptor
II
engagement
on
Egr-1
expression
during
stimulation
of
B
lymphocytes
by
membrane
immunoglobulin
crosslinking
.

Egr-1
is
an
immediate
early
gene
that
is
rapidly
upregulated
in
response
to
mitogenic
signals
induced
by
antigen
receptor
crosslinking
on
murine
B
lymphocytes
.

It
has
been
shown
that
levels
of
Egr-1
expression
are
closely
correlated
with
B
cell
proliferation
in
several
models
of
B
cell
activation
and
tolerance
.

We
compared
the
expression
of
Egr-1
during
B
cell
stimulation
with
Fab'2
and
IgG
anti-immunoglobulin
(
anti-Ig
)
,
since
it
is
known
that
Fab'2
anti-Ig
is
mitogenic
while
IgG
anti-Ig
is
not
,
owing
to
a
dominant
inhibitory
effect
of
crosslinking
the
B
cell
Fc
gamma
RII
to
membrane
Ig
.

While
mitogenic
doses
of
Fab'2
anti-Ig
induce
large
and
rapid
increases
in
Egr-1
expression
,
IgG
anti-Ig
results
in
smaller
increases
in
Egr-1
mRNA
,
comparable
to
that
seen
with
submitogenic
concentrations
of
Fab'2
anti-Ig
.

However
,
the
correlation
between
Egr-1
expression
and
B
cell
proliferation
breaks
down
when
IL-4
is
added
as
a
co-mitogen
to
induce
B
cell
proliferation
with
IgG
anti-Ig
or
submitogenic
concentrations
of
Fab'2
anti-Ig
.

No
corresponding
increases
in
Egr-1
mRNA
levels
are
observed
when
IL-4
is
added
.

Therefore
,
IL-4
overcomes
Fc
receptor-mediated
inhibition
of
B
cell
proliferation
without
affecting
inhibition
of
Egr-1
mRNA
induction
,
as
demonstrated
earlier
for
c-myc
mRNA
in
this
system
.

Identification
of
a
novel
cyclosporin-sensitive
element
in
the
human
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
gene
promoter
.

Tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
(
TNF-alpha
)
,
a
cytokine
with
pleiotropic
biological
effects
,
is
produced
by
a
variety
of
cell
types
in
response
to
induction
by
diverse
stimuli
.

In
this
paper
,
TNF-alpha
mRNA
is
shown
to
be
highly
induced
in
a
murine
T
cell
clone
by
stimulation
with
T
cell
receptor
(
TCR
)
ligands
or
by
calcium
ionophores
alone
.

Induction
is
rapid
,
does
not
require
de
novo
protein
synthesis
,
and
is
completely
blocked
by
the
immunosuppressant
cyclosporin
A
(
CsA
)
.

We
have
identified
a
human
TNF-alpha
promoter
element
,
kappa
3
,
which
plays
a
key
role
in
the
calcium-mediated
inducibility
and
CsA
sensitivity
of
the
gene
.

In
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
,
an
oligonucleotide
containing
kappa
3
forms
two
DNA
protein
complexes
with
proteins
that
are
present
in
extracts
from
unstimulated
T
cells
.

These
complexes
appear
in
nuclear
extracts
only
after
T
cell
stimulation
.

Induction
of
the
inducible
nuclear
complexes
is
rapid
,
independent
of
protein
synthesis
,
and
blocked
by
CsA
,
and
thus
,
exactly
parallels
the
induction
of
TNF-alpha
mRNA
by
TCR
ligands
or
by
calcium
ionophore
.

Our
studies
indicate
that
the
kappa
3
binding
factor
resembles
the
preexisting
component
of
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
.

Thus
,
the
TNF-alpha
gene
is
an
immediate
early
gene
in
activated
T
cells
and
provides
a
new
model
system
in
which
to
study
CsA-sensitive
gene
induction
in
activated
T
cells
.

Differences
in
expression
of
transcription
factor
AP-1
in
human
promyelocytic
HL-60
cells
during
differentiation
towards
macrophages
versus
granulocytes
.

Commitment
of
HL-60
cells
to
macrophage
or
granulocytic
differentiation
was
achieved
by
incubation
with
4
beta-phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
(
PMA
)
for
30-60
min
or
with
dimethyl
sulphoxide
(
DMSO
)
for
24
h
respectively
.

The
commitment
stage
towards
PMA-induced
macrophage
differentiation
was
associated
with
increases
in
jun
B
and
c-fos
mRNA
levels
,
as
well
as
with
an
increase
in
the
binding
activity
of
transcription
factor
AP-1
.

Nevertheless
,
gel
retardation
analysis
indicated
that
the
AP-1
activity
detected
in
untreated
cells
was
drastically
reduced
during
the
commitment
stage
of
DMSO-induced
HL-60
differentiation
towards
granulocytes
.

When
HL-60
cells
were
treated
with
sodium
butyrate
,
which
induced
monocytic
differentiation
,
a
remarkable
increase
in
AP-1
binding
activity
was
detected
.

Treatment
of
HL-60
cells
with
1
alpha
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
,
another
monocytic
differentiation
agent
,
induced
a
weak
,
but
appreciable
,
increase
in
AP-1
activity
.

Furthermore
,
addition
of
sodium
butyrate
or
1
alpha
,
25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3
to
HL-60
cells
induced
the
expression
of
c-fos
,
c-jun
,
jun
B
and
jun
D
proto-oncogenes
.

In
contrast
,
when
HL-60
cells
were
treated
with
retinoic
acid
,
a
granulocytic
differentiation
inducer
,
no
enhanced
AP-1
binding
activity
was
observed
,
and
only
a
weak
increase
in
jun
D
mRNA
level
was
detected
.

These
data
indicate
that
formation
of
AP-1
is
not
required
for
the
induction
of
HL-60
differentiation
towards
granulocytes
,
whereas
induction
of
monocytic
differentiation
is
correlated
with
an
increase
in
AP-1
activity
.

The
differential
expression
of
AP-1
activity
may
be
critical
in
the
differentiation
of
HL-60
cells
towards
monocytic
or
granulocytic
lineages

Glucocorticoid
receptors
and
sensitivity
in
leukemias
.

In
an
attempt
to
investigate
the
utility
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
determination
to
predict
clinical
responsiveness
in
human
leukemias
we
have
studied
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
the
leukemic
cells
from
46
patients
and
in
the
lymphocytes
from
18
normal
donors
.

In
the
normal
lymphocytes
there
were
3
,
875
(
Median
)
specific
binding
sites
per
cell
.

The
blasts
from
17
patients
with
ANLL
had
on
average
higher
levels
of
binding
sites
per
cell
(
Median
=
7
,
250
,
range
:
0
to
15
,
295
)
than
the
other
leukemias
.

Of
the
15
patients
with
CLL
,
six
had
received
glucocorticoid
treatment
for
3
to
5
years
.

Their
lymphocytes
had
lower
number
of
receptors
(
Median
=
2
,
000
)
than
the
other
cases
which
were
newly
diagnosed
(
Median
=
4
,
500
)
.

Four
patients
had
ALL/AUL
,
three
patients
had
blast
crisis
as
terminal
phase
of
CML
,
and
seven
had
leukemic
Non-Hodgkin
lymphomas
(
Median
=
3
,
500
sites/cell
)
.

In
24
patients
we
have
also
studied
the
in
vitro
sensitivity
of
the
leukemic
cells
to
dexamethasone
.

There
was
no
marked
correlation
between
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
and
in
vitro
sensitivity
.

An
attempt
to
correlate
receptor
levels
with
clinical
responsiveness
demonstrated
that
glucocorticoid
receptor
determination
might
be
of
value
in
patients
with
lymphoid
malignancies
but
probably
not
in
patients
with
other
leukemias
.

'Activation-labile
'
glucocorticoid-receptor
complexes
of
a
steroid-resistant
variant
of
CEM-C7
human
lymphoid
cells
.

For
cytoplasmic
glucocorticoid-receptor
complexes
to
enter
and
accumulate
in
the
nucleus
a
temperature-dependent
event
,
'activation
'
is
required
.

Activation
can
be
achieved
in
vitro
by
increased
ionic
strength
,
dilution
or
gel
filtration
and
is
manifested
by
an
increased
affinity
of
steroid-receptor
complex
for
DNA
and
an
altered
elution
profile
from
ion-exchange
resins
.

Munck
and
Foley
have
shown
that
activated
complexes
isolated
from
thymocytes
elute
from
DEAE-cellulose
in
a
manner
identical
to
complexes
activated
in
vitro
.

We
report
here
that
DEAE-cellulose
chromatography
of
steroid-receptor
complexes
from
CEM-C7
,
a
cloned
human
leukaemic
T-cell
line
sensitive
to
the
cytolytic
action
of
glucocorticoids
,
and
its
steroid-resistant
subclone
4R4
demonstrated
that
steroid
receptors
of
clone
4R4
can
not
form
stable
activated
complexes
.

This
defines
a
new
defect
in
receptor
action
,
activation
lability
(
r+act1
)
,
which
is
unlike
either
the
r-
,
r+nt-
,
or
r+nti
phenotypes
previously
described
for
mouse
lymphoid
variants
.

Granulocytes
in
the
endometrium
of
post-partum
women
.

Endometrial
samples
of
women
at
various
stages
of
gonadal
activity
after
parturition
were
examined
for
the
presence
and
numbers
of
endometrial
granulocytes
.

Although
samples
at
all
the
stages
contained
significant
numbers
of
the
granulocytes
(
i.e.
greater
than
7/high-power
field
)
,
the
100
%
values
for
late-proliferative
and
adaptation
hyperplasia
were
significantly
higher
than
the
values
for
the
resting
(
81.8
%
)
,
early
(
82.4
%
)
and
mid-
(
87.9
%
)
proliferative
and
secretory
(
83.3
%
)
phases
.

We
suggest
that
this
correlates
with
the
suggestion
that
the
granulocytes
constitute
a
receptor
system
for
oestrogens
.

Interaction
of
glucocorticoids
with
macrophages
.

Identification
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
monocytes
and
macrophages
.

Glucocorticoid
binding
was
measured
in
resident
and
thioglycollate-elicited
mouse
peritoneal
macrophages
,
rabbit
alveolar
macrophages
,
and
human
monocytes
.

Two
assays
of
binding
were
used
--
an
assay
with
intact
cells
in
suspension
or
monolayers
,
and
an
assay
of
cytosol
and
nuclear
forms
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
.

The
mononuclear
phagocytes
contained
approximately
equal
to
4
--
10
X
10
(
3
)
high
affinity
receptor
sites
per
cell
,
with
dissociation
constants
of
approximately
equal
to
2
--
8
nM
dexamethasone
.

The
binding
to
the
saturable
sites
was
specific
for
steroids
with
glucocorticoid
or
antiglucocorticoid
activity
.

Cortisol
,
corticosterone
,
and
progesterone
competed
with
dexamethasone
for
binding
,
whereas
estradiol
,
dihydrotestosterone
,
and
11-epicortisol
competed
very
little
.

Binding
of
dexamethasone
to
cytosol
and
nuclear
forms
of
the
receptor
complex
and
temperature-sensitive
translocation
of
cytosol
forms
to
nuclear
forms
were
shown
.

At
37
degrees
C
the
predominant
form
of
the
hormone-receptor
complex
was
nuclear
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
corticosteroids
interact
with
macrophages
at
physiological
concentrations
.

Nitric
oxide
signaling
:
a
possible
role
for
G
proteins
.

We
have
previously
reported
various
inductive
effects
of
nitric
oxide
on
human
PBMC
.

We
describe
a
novel
and
potentially
important
mechanism
of
nitric
oxide
signaling-through
direct
activation
of
guanine
nucleotide-binding
proteins
(
G
proteins
)
.

We
have
found
that
nitric
oxide
treatment
of
membranes
isolated
from
fresh
human
PBMC
enhances
the
ability
of
these
membranes
to
hydrolyze
[
gamma-32P
]
GTP
and
bind
[
gamma-35S
]
GTP
.

In
addition
,
treatment
of
whole
cells
with
nitric
oxide
yielded
membranes
with
enhanced
GTPase
activity
.

Furthermore
,
the
GTPase
activity
of
pure
,
recombinant
Gs
alpha
,
Gi
alpha
1
,
and
p21ras
was
greatly
enhanced
by
nitric
oxide
.

In
support
of
the
existence
of
this
pathway
in
whole
cells
,
we
found
that
the
G
protein
inhibitor
,
GDP-beta-S
,
blocked
NF-kappa
B
translocation
induced
by
nitric
oxide
or
LPS
in
permeabilized
cells
.

In
addition
,
nitric
oxide
greatly
reduced
the
pertussis
toxin-mediated
ADP-ribosylation
of
45-
and
41-kDa
proteins
in
membranes
of
these
cells
.

Because
G
proteins
play
a
central
role
in
many
diverse
signaling
systems
,
activation
by
an
endogenous
and
inducible
oxidant
may
represent
a
novel
signaling
pathway
.

The
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
promoter
cis-acting
element
CLE0
mediates
induction
signals
in
T
cells
and
is
recognized
by
factors
related
to
AP1
and
NFAT
.

Expression
of
the
granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(
GM-CSF
)
gene
in
T
cells
is
activated
by
the
combination
of
phorbol
ester
(
phorbol
myristate
acetate
)
and
calcium
ionophore
(
A23187
)
,
which
mimic
antigen
stimulation
through
the
T-cell
receptor
.

We
have
previously
shown
that
a
fragment
containing
bp
-95
to
+27
of
the
mouse
GM-CSF
promoter
can
confer
inducibility
to
reporter
genes
in
the
human
Jurkat
T-cell
line
.

Here
we
use
an
in
vitro
transcription
system
to
demonstrate
that
a
cis-acting
element
(
positions
-54
to
-40
)
,
referred
to
as
CLE0
,
is
a
target
for
the
induction
signals
.

We
observed
induction
with
templates
containing
intact
CLE0
but
not
with
templates
with
deleted
or
mutated
CLE0
.

We
also
observed
that
two
distinct
signals
were
required
for
the
stimulation
through
CLE0
,
since
only
extracts
from
cells
treated
with
both
phorbol
myristate
acetate
and
A23187
supported
optimal
induction
.

Stimulation
probably
was
mediated
by
CLE0-binding
proteins
because
depletion
of
these
proteins
specifically
reduced
GM-CSF
transcription
.

One
of
the
binding
factors
possessed
biochemical
and
immunological
features
identical
to
those
of
the
transcription
factor
AP1
.

Another
factor
resembled
the
T-cell-specific
factor
NFAT
.

The
characteristics
of
these
two
factors
are
consistent
with
their
involvement
in
GM-CSF
induction
.

The
presence
of
CLE0-like
elements
in
the
promoters
of
interleukin-3
(
IL-3
)
,
IL-4
,
IL-5
,
GM-CSF
,
and
NFAT
sites
in
the
IL-2
promoter
suggests
that
the
factors
we
detected
,
or
related
factors
that
recognize
these
sites
,
may
account
for
the
coordinate
induction
of
these
genes
during
T-cell
activation
.

Identification
and
characterization
of
an
Alu-containing
,
T-cell-specific
enhancer
located
in
the
last
intron
of
the
human
CD8
alpha
gene
.

Expression
of
the
human
CD8
alpha
gene
is
restricted
to
cells
of
the
lymphoid
lineage
and
developmentally
regulated
during
thymopoiesis
.

As
an
initial
step
towards
understanding
the
molecular
basis
for
tissue-specific
expression
of
this
gene
,
we
surveyed
the
surrounding
chromatin
structure
for
potential
cis-acting
regulatory
regions
by
DNase
I
hypersensitivity
mapping
and
found
four
hypersensitive
sites
,
three
of
which
were
T
cell
restricted
.

By
using
a
reporter-based
expression
approach
,
a
T-cell-specific
enhancer
was
identified
by
its
close
association
with
a
prominent
T-cell-restricted
hypersensitive
sites
in
the
last
intron
of
the
CD8
alpha
gene
.

Deletion
studies
demonstrated
that
the
minimal
enhancer
is
adjacent
to
a
negative
regulatory
element
.

DNA
sequence
analysis
of
the
minimal
enhancer
revealed
a
striking
cluster
of
consensus
binding
sites
for
Ets-1
,
TCF-1
,
CRE
,
GATA-3
,
LyF-1
,
and
bHLH
proteins
which
were
verified
by
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
.

In
addition
,
the
5
'
end
of
the
enhancer
was
composed
of
an
Alu
repeat
which
contained
the
GATA-3
,
bHLH
,
and
LyF-1
binding
sites
.

Site-directed
mutation
of
the
Ets-1
and
GATA-3
sites
dramatically
reduced
enhancer
activity
.

The
functional
importance
of
the
other
binding
sites
only
became
apparent
when
combinations
of
mutations
were
analyzed
.

Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
the
human
CD8
alpha
gene
is
regulated
by
the
interaction
of
multiple
T-cell
nuclear
proteins
with
a
transcriptional
enhancer
located
in
the
last
intron
of
the
gene
.

Comparison
of
the
CD8
alpha
enhancer
with
other
recently
identified
T-cell-specific
regulatory
elements
suggests
that
a
common
set
of
transcription
factors
regulates
several
T-cell
genes
.

Molecular
regulation
of
the
human
IL-3
gene
:
inducible
T
cell-restricted
expression
requires
intact
AP-1
and
Elf-1
nuclear
protein
binding
sites
.

Interleukin
3
(
IL-3
)
is
a
hematopoietic
stem-cell
growth
and
differentiation
factor
that
is
expressed
solely
in
activated
T
and
NK
cells
.

Studies
to
date
have
identified
elements
5
'
to
the
IL-3
coding
sequences
that
regulate
its
transcription
,
but
the
sequences
that
confer
T
cell-specific
expression
remain
to
be
clearly
defined
.

We
have
now
identified
DNA
sequences
that
are
required
for
T
cell-restricted
IL-3
gene
transcription
.

A
series
of
transient
transfections
performed
with
human
IL-3-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase
(
CAT
)
reporter
plasmids
in
T
and
non-T
cells
revealed
that
a
plasmid
containing
319
bp
of
5
'
flanking
sequences
was
active
exclusively
in
T
cells
.

Deletion
analysis
revealed
that
T
cell
specificity
was
conferred
by
a
49-bp
fragment
(
bp
-319
to
-270
)
that
included
a
potential
binding
site
for
AP-1
transcription
factors
6
bp
upstream
of
a
binding
site
for
Elf-1
,
a
member
of
the
Ets
family
of
transcription
factors
.

DNaseI
footprint
and
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
analyses
performed
with
MLA-144
T
cell
nuclear
extracts
demonstrated
that
this
49-bp
region
contains
a
nuclear
protein
binding
region
that
includes
consensus
AP-1
and
Elf-1
binding
sites
.

In
addition
,
extracts
prepared
from
purified
human
T
cells
contained
proteins
that
bound
to
synthetic
oligonucleotides
corresponding
to
the
AP-1
and
Elf-1
binding
sites
.

In
vitro-transcribed
and
-translated
Elf-1
protein
bound
specifically
to
the
Elf-1
site
,
and
Elf-1
antisera
competed
and
super
shifted
nuclear
protein
complexes
present
in
MLA-144
nuclear
extracts
.

Moreover
,
addition
of
anti-Jun
family
antiserum
in
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
reactions
completely
blocked
formation
of
the
AP-1-related
complexes
.

Transient
transfection
studies
in
MLA-144
T
cells
revealed
that
constructs
containing
mutations
in
the
AP-1
site
almost
completely
abolished
CAT
activity
while
mutation
of
the
Elf-1
site
or
the
NF-IL-3
site
,
a
previously
described
nuclear
protein
binding
site
(
bp.
-155
to
-148
)
in
the
IL-3
promoter
,
reduced
CAT
activity
to
<
25
%
of
the
activity
given
by
wild-type
constructs
.

We
conclude
that
expression
of
the
human
IL-3
gene
requires
the
AP-1
and
Elf-1
binding
sites
;
however
,
unlike
other
previously
characterized
cytokine
genes
such
as
IL-2
,
the
AP-1
and
Elf-1
factors
can
bind
independently
in
the
IL-3
gene
.

Combination

T
cell
response
to
glucocorticoids
.

The
mechanisms
contributing
to
persistent
T
cell
activation
and
poor
response
to
glucocorticoids
in
chronic
inflammatory
illnesses
such
as
steroid
resistant
(
SR
)
asthma
are
poorly
defined
.

We
examined
the
possibility
that
certain
cytokines
,
specifically
IL-2
and
IL-4
,
could
affect
T
cell
response
to
glucocorticoids
.

A
[
3H
]
dexamethasone
radioligand-binding
assay
was
used
to
measure
the
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
(
GR
)
and
dissociation
constant
(
Kd
)
in
PBMC
from
normal
donors
and
patients
with
SR
asthma
,
cultured
in
the
absence
and
presence
of
these
cytokines
.

PBMC
from
normal
donors
incubated
for
48
h
in
the
presence
of
combination
IL-2
+
IL-4
had
nuclear
GR
with
significantly
reduced
binding
affinity
(
GR
Kd
=
36.1
+/-
1.63
nM
,
mean
+/-
SEM
;
p
=
0.0001
)
as
compared
with
PBMC
incubated
with
medium
alone
(
GR
Kd
=
6.74
+/-
0.46
nM
)
.

The
cytosolic
GR
Kd
remained
unchanged
.

However
,
when
PBMC
were
incubated
with
IL-2
alone
or
IL-4
alone
,
no
change
in
GR-binding
affinity
was
observed
.

Furthermore
,
when
T
cells
and
non-T
cells
were
individually
stimulated
with
combination
IL-2
+
IL-4
,
a
significant
reduction
in
GR-binding
affinity
was
observed
only
in
the
T
cell
population
(
p
=
0.0001
)
.

The
IL-2
+
IL-4-induced
alteration
in
PBMC
GR
Kd
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
GR
number
(
8348
+/-
964
vs
1710
+/-
228
sites/cell
;
p
=
0.0003
)
.

More
importantly
,
the
alteration
in
PBMC
GR-binding
affinity
with
IL-2
+
IL-4
was
associated
with
a
functional
change
in
T
cell
response
to
methylprednisolone
MPN
,
i.e.
,
a
reduced
inhibitory
effect
of
MPN
on
PMA/ionomycin-induced
T
cell
proliferation
.

These
effects
of
IL-2
+
IL-4
on
PBMC
GR
affinity
and
response
to
MPN
were
blocked
by
co-incubation
with
IFN-gamma
.

Freshly
isolated
PBMC
from
four
patients
with
SR
asthma
had
a
significantly
reduced
GR-binding
affinity
(
Kd
=
40.0
+/-
2.68
nM
;
p
=
0.0001
)
when
compared
with
seven
normal
subjects
(
7.15
+/-
0.41
nM
)
.

The
altered
PBMC
GR
binding
from
patients
with
SR
asthma
reversed
to
normal
when
incubated
with
medium
alone
,
but
was
sustained
with
IL-2
+
IL-4
.

These
observations
suggest
that
with
persistent
inflammation
certain
cytokines
may
contribute
to
an
impaired
response
to
glucocorticoids
.

Furthermore
,
the
effects
of
IL-2
and
IL-4
were
blocked
by
IFN-gamma
.

Characterization
of
the
human
CD4
gene
promoter
:
transcription
from
the
CD4
gene
core
promoter
is
tissue-specific
and
is
activated
by
Ets
proteins
.

We
analyzed
the
5
'
transcription
control
sequences
of
the
human
CD4
gene
.

We
located
the
transcription
initiation
site
and
showed
that
the
CD4
core
promoter
(
positions
-40
to
+16
)
lacks
a
classical
``
TATA
''
or
initiator
positioning
consensus
sequence
but
directs
precise
and
efficient
transcription
when
coupled
to
the
ubiquitously
active
simian
virus
40
enhancer
.

The
transcriptional
activity
of
the
CD4
gene
promoter
correlated
with
CD4
expression
in
various
cell
types
.

Interestingly
,
the
CD4
core
promoter
also
displayed
a
tissue-specific
transcriptional
activity
.

Within
this
fragment
,
three
nucleic
acid
sequences
are
completely
conserved
in
the
murine
CD4
gene
.

One
of
these
sequences
contains
a
perfect
ETS
consensus
sequence
.

Another
ETS
consensus
sequence
is
located
1060
nt
upstream
.

Electrophoretic-mobility-shift
assays
showed
that
the
core
promoter
ETS
motif
binds
an
Ets-related
protein
specifically
expressed
at
high
levels
in
CD4+
cells
.

Moreover
,
in
CD4-
cells
,
overexpression
of
Ets-1
or
Ets-2
efficiently
and
specifically
activated
transcription
from
the
CD4
promoter
and
core
promoter
.

These
data
indicate
that
Ets
transcription
factors
play
a
central
role
in
controlling
CD4
gene
expression
,
by
binding
to
both
a
classical
remote
site
and
an
unusual
proximal
activator

Glucocorticoid
receptor
activation
and
inactivation
in
c
ultured
human
lymphocytes
.

Although
glucocorticoids
are
not
cytolytic
for
and
do
not
inhibit
the
growth
of
the
IM-9
line
of
cultured
human
lymphoblasts
,
these
cells
have
a
high
steroid-binding
capacity
.

We
have
used
IM-9
cells
in
order
to
examine
whether
unoccupied
glucocorticoid
receptors
are
inactivated
and
activated
in
intact
cells
.

when
IM-9
cells
are
incubated
in
glucose-free
medium
in
a
nitrogen
atmosphere
,
both
their
ability
to
bind
triamcinolone
acetonide
and
their
ATP
levels
decline
and
,
when
glucose
and
oxygen
are
reintroduced
,
ATP
levels
and
receptor
activity
return
.

The
specific
glucocorticoid-binding
activity
of
cytosol
prepared
from
cells
exposed
to
various
degrees
of
energy
limitation
is
directly
correlated
with
the
ATP
content
.

Receptor
activation
in
intact
cells
is
rapid
and
independent
of
protein
synthesis
.

Cytosol
prepared
from
inactivated
cells
can
not
be
activated
by
addition
of
ATP
.

The
inactivation
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
that
occurs
when
cytosol
from
normal
IM-9
cells
is
incubated
at
25
degrees
C
is
inhibited
by
molybdate
,
vanadate
,
fluoride
,
ATP
,
and
several
other
nucleotides
.

The
experiments
with
intact
human
lymphoblasts
suggest
that
assays
of
specific
glucocorticoid-binding
capacity
do
not
necessarily
reflect
the
cellular
content
of
receptor
protein
.

Cell
cycle-dependent
changes
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
content
.

To
study
variations
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
during
the
cell
cycle
,
we
have
separated
mitogen-stimulated
human
peripheral
lymphocytes
and
rat
lymph
node
cells
by
unit
gravity
sedimentation
and
measured
glucocorticoid
binding
in
the
resultant
fractions
.

By
morphologic
criteria
and
thymidine
incorporation
,
the
fractions
were
separated
into
populations
of
G0
and
G1
phase
and
S
and
post-S
phase
cells
.

A
2-
to
3-fold
increase
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
per
cell
,
for
cells
in
the
S
and
post-S
phase
over
those
in
G0
and
G1
,
was
observed
with
both
nonstimulated
rat
lymph
node
cell
suspensions
and
concanavalin
A-stimulated
human
peripheral
lymphocytes
.

These
observations
together
with
those
from
other
studies
indicate
that
formation
of
new
glucocorticoid
receptors
near
the
S
phase
may
be
a
general
phenomenon
in
proliferating
cells
.

We
propose
that
this
increase
in
glucocorticoid
receptors
during
the
cell
cycle
may
explain
the
increase
in
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
mitogen-stimulated
lymphocytes
.

The
leukocyte
migration
inhibition
response
to
certain
breast
cancer-related
antigens
(
MCF-7
and
MuMTV
)
:
their
potential
as
discriminants
.

Certain
oncogenic
viruses
have
been
implicated
in
human
breast
cancer
,
including
the
murine
mammary
tumor
virus
(
MuMTV
)
and
the
Mason-Pfizer
monkey
virus
(
MPMV
)
.

We
have
used
the
leukocyte
migration
inhibition
(
LMI
)
response
to
assay
the
response
to
several
potential
breast
cancer-related
antigens
,
including
MuMTV
,
MPMV
,
and
a
breast
cancer
cultured
cell
line
,
MCF-7
,
in
96
breast
cancer
patients
,
in
32
women
with
benign
breast
disease
,
and
in
67
normal
women
.

The
lowest
tenth
percentile
of
control
(
LMI
)
responses
was
used
as
the
cutoff
point
to
designate
responders
.

Breast
cancer
patients
showed
significant
responses
to
MuMTV
(
49
%
and
to
MCF-7
(
50
%
)
,
but
not
to
MPMV
(
29
%
)
.

In
a
paired-antigen
study
using
MuMTV
and
MCF-7
,
75
%
of
the
breast
cancer
patients
responded
,
versus
18
%
of
the
normal
women
(
P
less
than
0.0050
)
.

The
potential
for
this
assay
to
distinguish
``
normal
''
from
``
breast
cancer
''
was
analyzed
using
a
migration
index
derived
from
discriminant
analysis
.

The
ability
of
the
assay
to
discriminate
``
normal
''
from
``
cancer
''
was
significant
(
P
less
than
0.001
)
and
showed
a
sensitivity
of
detecting
``
cancer
''
of
75
%
.

The
overall
responses
to
MuMTV
and
MCF-7
were
analyzed
with
reference
to
certain
prognostic
factors
,
but
showed
no
relation
to
age
,
menstrual
status
,
estrogen
receptor
status
,
or
stage
of
disease
.

The
above
reactions
suggest
that
a
large
proportion
of
breast
cancer
patients
exhibit
presensitization
to
antigenfs
found
in
MuMTV
and
MCF-7
,
which
may
be
cross-reactive
with
antigens
in
the
primary
cancer
.

These
responses
appear
to
be
independent
of
major
prognostic
variables
.

Further
refinement
of
this
assay
may
yield
one
which
is
more
highly
discriminating
for
breast
cancer
.

Chronic
lymphatic
leukaemia
:
cellular
effects
of
glucocorticoids
in

.

Glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
and
steroid
induced
inhibition
of
nucleic
acid
precursors
have
been
examined
in
lymphocytes
from
27
patients
at
different
stages
of
chronic
lymphatic
leukaemia
.

No
correlation
can
be
found
between
the
level
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
the
stage
of
the
disease
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
significant
difference
(
P
less
than
0.02
)
was
found
between
stage
O
and
stage
III/IV
patients
,
in

of
the
in

of

Pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate
inhibits
NF-kappa
B
mobilization
and
TNF
production
in
human
monocytes
.

The
human
TNF
promoter
contains
four
potential
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(
NF-kappa
B
)
-binding
sites
,
with
the
strongest
binding
seen
for
the
-605
motif
.

Nuclear
extracts
from
unstimulated
cells
of
the
human
monocytic
cell
line
,
Mono
Mac
6
,
contain
one
specific
binding
protein
(
complex
II
)
,
consistent
with
a
constitutive
p50
homodimer
.

Stimulation
of
Mono
Mac
6
cells
with
LPS
will
increase
complex
II
and
will
strongly
induce
a
second
specific
complex
(
complex
I
)
,
which
represents
the
p50/65
heterodimer
.

Treatment
of
Mono
Mac
6
cells
with
pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate
(
PDTC
)
at
300
microM
will
block
the
LPS-induced
complex
I
almost
completely
and
will
reduce
complex
II
to
the
constitutive
level
.

Binding
activity
of
other
nuclear
factors
that
recognize
the
SP-1
and
c/EBP
motifs
of
the
human
TNF
promoter
is
not
affected
by
such
treatment
.

Northern
blot
analysis
demonstrates
that
PDTC
treatment
will
strongly
reduce
LPS-induced
TNF
transcripts
.

Secreted
TNF
protein
as
detected
in
the
Wehi
164S/ActD
bioassay
and
in
a
sandwich
immunoassay
was
similarly
reduced
by
PDTC
.

Kinetic
analyses
show
that
after
LPS
stimulation
,
NF-kappa
B
will
peak
at
1
h
,
TNF
transcript
prevalence
at
2
h
,
and
TNF
protein
at
4
h
.

PDTC
did
not
shift
this
response
to
LPS
to
a
later
time
,
but
suppressed
NF-kappa
B
mobilization
,
TNF
transcripts
,
and
TNF
protein
over
the
entire
8-h
observation
period
.

Analysis
of
freshly
isolated
,
LPS-stimulated
blood
monocytes
showed
a
similar
blockade
of
NF-kappa
B
.

Furthermore
,
in
these
primary
cells
,
induction
of
TNF
transcripts
,
as
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis
and
by
quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
,
was
prevented
by
PDTC
as
was
TNF
protein
production
.

These
data
show
that
dithiocarbamates
can
profoundly
affect
cytokine
expression
and
suggest
that
NF-kappa
B
is
involved
in
LPS-induced
TNF
gene
expression
in
human
monocytes
.

Comparing
regions
of
the
Epstein-Barr
virus
ZEBRA
protein
which
function
as
transcriptional
activating
sequences
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
and
in
B
cells
.

The
ZEBRA
protein
activates
expression
of
Epstein-Barr
virus
early-lytic-cycle
genes
in
human
B
lymphocytes
.

Here
it
is
shown
that
ZEBRA
also
behaves
as
a
sequence-specific
transcriptional
activator
in
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
.

Deletional
mutagenesis
defined
three
regions
of
ZEBRA
that
participate
in
activation
in
S.
cerevisiae
.

These
regions
are
designated
YI
(
amino
acids
[
aa
]
1
to
25
)
,
YII
(
aa
51
to
102
)
,
and
YIII
(
aa
228
to
245
)
.

Two
of
the
three
regions
of
the
native
ZEBRA
protein
act
together
to
mediate
activation
when
assayed
on
ZEBRA
binding
sites
.

However
,
when
fused
to
the
DNA
binding
domain
of
GAL
4
and
assayed
on
GAL4
binding
sites
,
regions
YII
and
YIII
were
each
sufficient
to
confer
activation
in
S.
cerevisiae
.

Regions
of
ZEBRA
which
affected
activation
in
S.
cerevisiae
were
also
required
in
human
B
lymphocytes
.

The
amino-terminal
region
of
ZEBRA
(
aa
1
to
98
)
was
required
for
activation
both
in
S.
cerevisiae
and
in
human
B
cells
;
deletion
of
the
carboxy-terminal
18
aa
also
significantly
reduced
activation
in
both
cell
types
.

Thus
,
the
behavior
of
ZEBRA
in
human
B
cells
and
S.
cerevisiae
suggests
that
the
protein
contains
universal
activation
motifs
that
interact
with
conserved
components
of
the
transcription
machinery
.

However
,
certain
deletion
mutants
of
ZEBRA
containing
mutations
in
the
N-terminal
region
exhibited
discordant
behaviors
in
S.
cerevisiae
and
in
B
cells
.

For
example
,
deletion
of
ZEBRA
aa
26
to
51
impaired
activation
to
a
great
extent
in
B
cells
but
had
little
or
no
effect
in
S.
cerevisiae
.

The
discordant
mutants
may
reflect
interactions
with
a
variable
domain
of
a
conserved
component
or
unique
interactions
with
specialized
components
of
the
basal
transcription
apparatus
in
different
cells
.

Functional
interaction
of
the
v-Rel
and
c-Rel
oncoproteins
with
the
TATA-binding
protein
and
association
with
transcription
factor
IIB
.

Rel
family
proteins
regulate
the
expression
of
genes
linked
to
kappa
B-binding
motifs
.

Little
is
known
,
however
,
of
the
mechanism
by
which
they
enhance
transcription
.

We
have
investigated
the
ability
of
the
v-Rel
and
c-Rel
oncoproteins
to
interact
with
components
of
the
basal
transcription
machinery
.

Here
we
report
that
both
the
acidic
transcription
activation
domain
mapping
to
the
unique
C
terminus
of
chicken
c-Rel
and
the
F9
cell-specific
activation
region
common
to
both
v-Rel
and
c-Rel
interact
with
the
TATA-binding
protein
(
TBP
)
and
transcription
factor
IIB
(
TFIIB
)
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

We
also
demonstrate
that
TPB
interaction
with
Rel
activation
regions
leads
to
synergistic
activation
of
transcription
of
a
kappa
B-linked
reporter
gene
.

Combined
with
the
observation
that
the
mouse
c-Rel
and
human
RelA
proteins
also
interact
with
TBP
and
TFIIB
in
vitro
,
these
results
suggest
that
association
with
basal
transcription
factors
is
important
for
the
transcriptional
activities
of
Rel
family
proteins
.

p21ras
and
calcineurin
synergize
to
regulate
the
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
.

In
T
lymphocytes
,
triggering
of
the
T
cell
receptor
(
TCR
)
induces
several
signaling
cascades
which
ultimately
synergize
to
induce
the
activity
of
the
nuclear
factor
of
activated
T
cells
(
NFAT
)
,
a
DNA
binding
complex
critical
to
the
inducibility
and
T
cell
specificity
of
the
T
cell
growth
factor
interleukin
2
.

One
immediate
consequence
of
T
cell
activation
via
the
TCR
is
an
increase
in
cytosolic
calcium
.

Calcium
signals
are
important
for
NFAT
induction
,
and
recent
studies
have
identified
calcineurin
,
a
calcium-calmodulin
dependent
serine-threonine
phosphatase
,
as
a
prominent
component
of
the
calcium
signaling
pathway
in
T
cells
.

A
second
important
molecule
in
TCR
signal
transduction
is
the
guanine
nucleotide
binding
protein
,
p21ras
,
which
is
coupled
to
the
TCR
by
a
protein
tyrosine
kinase
dependent
mechanism
.

The
experiments
presented
here
show
that
expression
by
transfection
of
mutationally
activated
calcineurin
or
activated
p21ras
alone
is
insufficient
for
NFAT
transactivation
.

However
,
coexpression
of
the
activated
calcineurin
with
activated
p21ras
could
mimic
TCR

Expression
of
the
chicken
GATA
factor
family
during
early
erythroid
development
and
differentiation
.

The
DNA
motif
WGATAR
has
been
identified
within
transcriptional
regulatory
domains
of
globin
and
other
erythroid-specific
genes
and
the
activator
proteins
that
bind
to
this
regulatory
element
,
the
GATA
factors
,
belong
to
a
multi-gene
family
that
is
expressed
in
chicken
erythroid
cells
.

Here
we
show
that
,
as
in
chickens
,
multiple
members
of
the
GATA
factor
family
are
expressed
in
human
and
murine
erythroid
cells
.

During
the
early
stages
of
chicken
embryogenesis
(
well
before
blood
island
formation
)
,
each
of
the
GATA
family
members
is
transcribed
with
a
unique
temporal
and
spatial
pattern
.

In
the
primitive
erythroid
lineage
,
transcription
of
the
embryonic
epsilon-globin
gene
parallels
GATA-1
expression
while
the
switch
to
beta-globin
transcription
in
definitive
erythroid
cells
is
directly
preceded
by
a
pronounced
increase
in
GATA-3
accumulation
.

The
timing
and
pattern
of
expression
of
these
different
mRNAs
during
avian
erythroid
development
and
differentiation
suggests
that
temporally
regulated
changes
in
GATA
factor
expression
are
required
for
vertebrate
hematopoiesis
.

Molecular
regulation
of
human
interleukin
2
and
T-cell
function
by
interleukin
4
.

Distinct
functional
T-cell
subsets
,
differing
in
the
patterns
of
lymphokines
produced
,
regulate
cell-mediated
and
humoral
immune
responses
.

The
two
major
types
and
their
principal
products
,
interleukin
4
and
interferon
gamma
(
IL-4
and
IFN-gamma
)
,
are
reciprocally
negatively
interactive
.

To
analyze
the
molecular
mechanism
of
IL-4-mediated
suppression
of
cell-mediated
immunity
we
studied
its
effects
on
expression
of
interleukin
2
(
IL-2
)
and
IFN-gamma
.

IL-4
pretreatment
of
Jurkat
cells
prior
to
stimulation
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
transcription
of
the
IL2
gene
.

IL-4
suppressed
IL-2
and
IFN-gamma
mRNA
levels
in
primary
human
T
cells
,
and
addition
of
anti-CD28
antibodies
relieved
this
suppression
.

Using
enhancer-reporter
constructs
,
IL-4
specifically
down-regulated
the
NFIL-2B
element
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
using
a
DNA
oligomer
containing
the
NFIL-2B
binding
site
indicated
that
IL-4
inhibited
the
NFIL-2B
complex
and
that
the
NFIL-2B
DNA
binding
factor
is
distinct
from
AP-
1
.

These
results
suggest
that
IL-4
may
regulate
development
and
function
of
T-cell
subsets
involved
in
cell-mediated
immunity
in
part
by
inhibiting
factors
required
for
transcription
of
the
IL2
gene

Immunochemical
differences
between
glucocorticoid
receptors
from
corticoid-sensitive
and
-resistant
malignant
lymphocytes
.

We
have
explored
the
possibility
of
using
antibodies
against
purified
rat
liver
glucocorticoid
receptors
to
study
the
immunochemical
properties
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
from
murine
and
human
malignant
lymphocytes
.

For
this
purpose
,
purified
immune
immunoglobulin
G
was
covalently
linked
to
Sepharose
CL-4B
.

We
then
examined
the
ability
of
the
affinity
gel
to
recognize
cytosolic
[
3H
]
triamcinolone
acetonide-receptor
complexes
from
the
corticoid-sensitive
(
CS
)
and
-resistant
strains
of
mouse
lymphoma
P1798
,
from
CS
lymphocytes
of
patients
with
chronic
lymphatic
leukemia
,
and
from
a
CS
clone
of
human
leukemic
lymphoblasts
in
tissue
culture
(
CH6
)
.

Mouse
thymus
was
used
as
a
source
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
from
normal
CS
lymphocytes
.

Whereas
the
immunoaffinity
column
retained
70
to
84
%
of
the
58-
to
62-A
(
Stokes
radius
)
[
3H
]
triamcinolone
acetonide-receptor
complexes
characteristic
of
the
CS
mouse
and
human
lymphocytes
,
it
failed
to
recognize
the
27-
to
28-A
(
Stokes
radius
)
glucocorticoid
receptor
present
in
corticoid-resistant
mouse
lymphoma
P1798
cells
.

Therefore
,
under
appropriate
experimental
conditions
,
it
was
possible
to
demonstrate
cross-reactivity
between
the
antiserum
against
rat
liver
glucocorticoid
receptor
and
the
58-
to
62-A
(
Stokes
radius
)
glucocorticoid
receptor
from
species
as
diverse
as
mouse
and
humans
.

Heterogeneity
of
the
in
vitro
responses
to
glucocorticoids
in
acute
leukemia
.

In
leukocyte
population
freshly
isolated
from
the
blood
of
26
patients
with
acute
leukemia
,
we
have
measured
several
parameters
including
glucocorticoid
receptors
,
nucleoside
incorporation
,
percentage
of
cells
in
S
phase
,
and
steroid-induced
cell
lysis
.

In
addition
,
in
some
cases
,
the
short-term
response
to
steroid
therapy
was
determined
.

Although
,
in
all
the
patients
studied
,
leukocytes
were
found
to
contain
glucocorticoid
receptors
,
we
failed
to
demonstrate
any
correlation
between
the
level
of
binding
sites
and
the
in
vitro
or
in
vivo
response
to
glucocorticoids
.

This
absence
of
correlation
could
be
in
part
explained
by
the
marked
heterogeneity
of
the
steroid
response
demonstrated
in
leukocyte
subpopulations
.

It
appears
,
however
,
that
the
degree
of
steroid
action
in
vitro
as
well
as
the
extent
of
spontaneous
and
dexamethasone-induced
cell
death
may
be
related
to
the
number
of
cells
in
the
S
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Glucocorticoid

Cortisol

The

by

the

of
the

Corticosteroid-induced
lymphopenia
,
immunosuppression
,
and
body
defense
.

The
apparent
paradox
of
heightened
adrenal
corticosteroid
levels
associated
with
reduction
in
the
competence
of
the
body
's
defensive
apparatus
to
cope
with
exposure
to
new
microbial
antigens
is
considered
.

The
question
is
asked
how
this
lowered
defensive
capability
,
which
occurs
in
the
face
of
a
threat
to
body
integrity
,
is
consistent
with
Cannon
's
principals
of
the
``
wisdom
of
the
body.
''

The
suggestion
is
offered
that
the
immunologic
response
to
self-antigens
exposed
by
disease
or
trauma
may
be
suppressed
by
corticosteroid
to
offset
the
likelihood
of
autoimmune
attack
.

Protein
tyrosine
kinase
activation
is
required
for
lipopolysaccharide
induction
of
cytokines
in
human
blood
monocytes
.

Bacterial
LPS
induce
production
of
cytokines
such
as
IL-1
,
IL-6
,
and
TNF
in
mononuclear
phagocytes
,
and
this
represents
a
central
component
in
the
pathogenesis
of
septic
shock
syndrome
.

However
,
the
mechanisms
by
which
LPS
activates
these
cells
to
express
cytokines
are
not
completely
characterized
.

The
present
study
addressed
the
role
of
different
protein
kinases
in
the
LPS
induction
of
cytokines
.

It
is
shown
that
LPS
induced
a
12-
to
16-fold
increase
in
IL-1
beta
,
IL-6
,
and
TNF-alpha
mRNA
levels
,
and
this
was
completely
or
more
than
80
%
blocked
by
the
protein
tyrosine
kinase
specific
inhibitors
herbimycin
A
and
genistein
at
the
concentrations
of
1.7
and
37
microM
,
respectively
.

Protein
kinase
C
inhibition
by
staurosporine
reduced
LPS
induction
of
TNF-alpha
,
whereas
it
had
no
effects
on
IL-6
and
IL-1
beta
.

Inhibition
of
protein
kinase
A
by
H89
reduced
IL-6
mRNA
levels
but
did
not
detectably
change
IL-1
beta
or
TNF-alpha
mRNA
levels
.

In
contrast
,
LPS
did
not
increase
leukemia
inhibitory
factor
mRNA
,
which
was
constitutively
expressed
and
not
significantly
reduced
by
these
inhibitors
.

In
addition
to
cytokine
mRNA
levels
,
LPS-induced
IL-6
protein
synthesis
and
IL-6
bioactivity
were
also
reduced
to
baseline
levels
by
the
PTK
inhibitors
herbimycin
A
and
genistein
.

Both
PTK
inhibitors
also
reduced
the
LPS
activation
of
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(
NF-kappa
B
)
,
which
is
a
transcription
factor
involved
in
the
expression
of
cytokine
genes
such
as
IL-6
and
TNF-alpha
.

The
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
was
also
reduced
by
H89
,
whereas
staurosporine
had
no
effect
on
this
response
.

In
summary
,
these
findings
suggest
that
protein
kinase
C
and
protein
kinase
A
appear
to
have
selective
effects
in
the
LPS
induction
of
cytokines
,
whereas
PTK
is
required
for
LPS
induction
of
a
broad
spectrum
of
cytokines
and
NF-kappa
B
activation
in
monocytes
.

In
vivo
control
of
NF-kappa
B
activation
by
I
kappa
B
alpha
.

The
transcription
factor
NF-kappa
B
is
stored
in
the
cytoplasm
in
complexes
with
the
inhibitor
protein
I
kappa
B
alpha
.

It
has
been
shown
in
vitro
that
dissociation
of
I
kappa
B
alpha
from
these
complexes
results
in
active
NF-kappa
B
.

In
this
report
we
show
that
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
-induced
activation
of
B
or
pre-B
cells
results
in
loss
of
I
kappa
B
alpha
from
NF-kappa
B
complexes
in
vivo
.

Many
liberated
NF-kappa
B
dimers
reached
the
nucleus
,
where
increased
c-rel
,
p65
and
p50
were
detected
by
immunoblotting
and
by
DNA
binding
assays
.

Some
liberated
dimers
were
retained
in
the
cytoplasm
,
however
,
through
binding
to
newly
synthesized
I
kappa
B
alpha
,
a
finding
which
strongly
suggests
(
i
)
that
the
LPS-induced
signal
causes
dissociation
of
complexes
rather
than
preventing
their
association
and
(
ii
)
that
dissociation
results
from
modification
of
I
kappa
B
alpha
and
not
of
c-rel
or
p65
.

No
effect
of
LPS
treatment
was
detected
on
p105
or
p100
,
which
also
retain
rel
family
members
in
the
cytoplasm
.

Quite
unexpectedly
,
we
also
found
that
in
unstimulated
cells
there
is
a
constant
ongoing
process
of
degradation
and
replacement
of
complexed
I
kappa
B
alpha
.

We
propose
that
this
turnover
results
in
the
low
level
of
active
NF-kappa
B
presumably
necessary
even
in
the
unstimulated
cell
,
and
that
the
high
rate
of
synthesis
of
I
kappa
B
alpha
provides
the
ability
to
turn
off
NF-kappa
B
activity
rapidly
as
soon
as
the
activating
signal
ceases
.

Identification
of
a
killer
cell-specific
regulatory
element
of
the
mouse
perforin
gene
:
an
Ets-binding
site-homologous
motif
that
interacts
with
Ets-related
proteins
.

The
gene
encoding
the
cytolytic
protein
perforin
is
selectively
expressed
by
activated
killer
lymphocytes
.

To
understand
the
mechanisms
underlying
the
cell-type-specific
expression
of
this
gene
,
we
have
characterized
the
regulatory
functions
and
the
DNA-protein
interactions
of
the
5'-flanking
region
of
the
mouse
perforin
gene
(
Pfp
)
.

A
region
extending
from
residues
+62
through
-141
,
which
possesses
the
essential
promoter
activity
,
and
regions
further
upstream
,
which
are
able
to
either
enhance
or
suppress
gene
expression
,
were
identified
.

The
region
between
residues
-411
and
-566
was
chosen
for
further
characterization
,
since
it
contains
an
enhancer-like
activity
.

We
have
identified
a
32-mer
sequence
(
residues
-491
to
-522
)
which
appeared
to
be
capable
of
enhancing
gene
expression
in
a
killer
cell-specific
manner
.

Within
this
segment
,
a
9-mer
motif
(
5'-ACAGGAAGT-3
'
,
residues
-505
to
-497
;
designated
NF-P
motif
)
,
which
is
highly
homologous
to
the
Ets
proto-oncoprotein-binding
site
,
was
found
to
interact
with
two
proteins
,
NF-P1
and
NF-P2
.

NF-P2
appears
to
be
induced
by
reagents
known
to
up-regulate
the
perforin
message
level
and
is
present
exclusively
in
killer
cells
.

Electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
and
UV
cross-linking
experiments
revealed
that
NF-P1
and
NF-P2
may
possess
common
DNA-binding
subunits
.

However
,
the
larger
native
molecular
mass
of
NF-P1
suggests
that
NF-P1
contains
an
additional
non-DNA-binding
subunit
(
s
)
.

In
view
of
the
homology
between
the
NF-P
motif
and
other
Ets
proto-oncoprotein-binding
sites
,
it
is
postulated
that
NF-P1
and
NF-P2
belong
to
the
Ets
protein
family
.

Results
obtained
from
the
binding
competition
assay
,
nevertheless
,
suggest
that
NF-P1
and
NF-P2
are
related
to
but
distinct
from
Ets
proteins
,
e.g.
,
Ets-1
,
Ets-2
,
and
NF-AT/Elf-1
,
known
to
be
expressed
in
T
cells
.

The
role
of
NF-kappa
B1
(
p50/p105
)
gene
expression
in
activation
of
human
blood
T-lymphocytes
via
CD2
and
CD28
adhesion
molecules
.

Stimulation
of
primary
human
T-lymphocytes
via
CD2
and
CD28
adhesion
molecules
induces
a
long-lasting
proliferation
(
>
3
weeks
)
.

This
potent
activation
does
not
require
accessory
cells
,
such
as
monocytes
,
but
depends
on
persistent
interleukin
2
(
IL-2
)
secretion
and
receptivity
,
which
is
associated
with
high
and
prolonged
expression
of
the
inducible
CD25/IL-2
receptor
alpha
(
IL-2R
alpha
)
chain
gene
.

The
transcription
factor
NF-kappa
B
participates
in
the
regulation
of
both
IL-2
and
IL-2R
alpha
genes
,
as
well
as
multiple
cellular
genes
involved
in
T-cell
proliferation
.

To
evaluate
the
role
of
NF-kappa
B
in
human
peripheral
blood
T-lymphocytes
,
we
previously
analyzed
the
activation
of
NF-kappa
B-related
complexes
in
response
to
CD2+CD28
costimulation
.

We
demonstrated
a
long-term
induction
of
p50/p65
heterodimer
,
a
putative
p65/c-Rel
heterodimer
,
and
a
constitutive
nuclear
expression
of
KBF1/p50
homodimers
.

As
the
role
of
p50
remains
unclear
,
we
focused
our
present
study
on
NF-kappa
B1
(
p50/p105
)
gene
regulation
.

Using
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assays
and
Western
and
Northern
blot
analyses
,
we
studied
NF-kappa
B1
gene
expression
during
T-cell
stimulation
via
CD2+CD28
.

We
observed
a
transient
4-
to
5-fold
increase
of
NF-kappa
B1
gene
expression
at
both
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
,
lasting
for
at
least
24
h
.

p50
DNA-binding
activity
apparently
stays
highly
controlled
when
p105
expression
is
enhanced
by
a
physiological
stimulus
of
peripheral
blood
T-cells
.

Partial
inhibition
of
p50
and
p105
expression
by
NF-kappa
B1
antisense
oligonucleotides
significantly
reduced
T-cell
proliferation
and
CD25/IL-2R
alpha
cell
surface
expression
.

TRUNCATED

Vitamin
D
receptor
quantitation
in
human
blood
mononuclear
cells
in
health
and
disease
.

Vitamin
D
receptor
(
VDR
)
concentration
was
quantitated
in
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
from
patients
with
absorptive
hypercalciuria
(
AH
)
and
patients
with
high
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
due
to
acquired
or
transient
disease
states
and
the
results
compared
to
those
in
normal
subjects
.

VDR
concentration
in
resting
cells
was
not
different
between
the
three
groups
and
represented
constitutive
receptor
expression
of
monocytes
.

Following
activation
with
phytohemagglutinin
,
patients
with
hypercalcitriolemia
demonstrated
significantly
greater
VDR
concentrations
.

Patients
with
AH
demonstrated
a
normal
value
for
the
group
,
but
6
patients
had
significantly
greater
concentrations
of
VDR
despite
normal
plasma
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
in
four
of
the
patients
.

Proliferation
,
as
assessed
from
[
3H
]
thymidine
incorporation
was
inversely
correlated
with
serum
1
,
25
(
OH
)
2D3
and
was
significant
(
R
=
-0.299
,
p
=
0.048
)
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
suggest
that
PBMC
provide
a
useful
system
for
studying
VDR
status
in
transient
or
acquired
states
of
hypercalcitriolemia
.

Furthermore
,
the
studies
in
patients
with
absorptive
hypercalciuria
disclosed
it
to
be
a
heterogeneous
disorder
,
characterized
by
both
vitamin
D-dependent
and
D-independent
forms
of

up-regulation

Reactive
oxygen
intermediates
activate
NF-kappa
B
in
a
tyrosine
kinase-dependent
mechanism
and
in
combination
with
vanadate
activate
the
p56lck
and
p59fyn
tyrosine
kinases
in
human
lymphocytes
.

We
have
previously
observed
that
ionizing
radiation
induces
tyrosine
phosphorylation
in
human
B-lymphocyte
precursors
by
stimulation
of
unidentified
tyrosine
kinases
and
this
phosphorylation
is
substantially
augmented
by
vanadate
.

Ionizing
radiation
generates
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
(
ROI
)
.

Because
H2O2
is
a
potent
ROI
generator
that
readily
crosses
the
plasma
membrane
,
we
used
H2O2
to
examine
the
effects
of
ROI
on
signal
transduction
.

We
now
provide
evidence
that
the
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitor
herbimycin
A
and
the
free
radical
scavenger
N-acetyl-cysteine
inhibit
both
radiation-induced
and
H2O2-induced
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
,
indicating
that
activation
triggered
by
ROI
is
dependent
on
tyrosine
kinase
activity
.

H2O2
was
found
to
stimulate
Ins-1
,
4
,
5-P3
production
in
a
tyrosine
kinase-dependent
manner
and
to
induce
calcium
signals
that
were
greatly
augmented
by
vanadate
.

The
synergistic
induction
of
tyrosine
phosphorylation
by
H2O2
plus
vanadate
included
physiologically
relevant
proteins
such
as
PLC
gamma
1
.

Although
treatment
of
cells
with
H2O2
alone
did
not
affect
the
activity
of
src
family
kinases
,
treatment
with
H2O2
plus
vanadate
led
to
activation
of
the
p56lck
and
p59fyn
tyrosine
kinases
.

The
combined
inhibition
of
phosphatases
and
activation
of
kinases
provides
a
potent
mechanism
for
the
synergistic
effects
of
H2O2
plus
vanadate
.

Induction
of
tyrosine
phosphorylation
by
ROI
may
thus
lead
to
many
of
the
pleiotropic
effects
of
ROI
in
lymphoid
cells
,
including
downstream
activation
of
PLC
gamma
1
and
NF-kappa
B

Influence
of
sex
hormone
binding
globulin
and
serum
albumin
on
the
conversion
of
androstenedione
to
testosterone
by
human
erythrocytes
.

The
influence
of
human
serum
albumin
and
sex
hormone
binding
globulin
(
SHBG
)
on
the
enzymic
conversion
of
androstenedione
to
testosterone
in
human
erythrocytes
was
investigated
in
vitro
.

Total
plasma
and
albumin
delayed
the
conversion
rate
of
androstenedione
,
while
SHBG
increased
it
markedly
.

The
effect
of
SHBG
was
largely
abolished
by
heating
to
60
degrees
C
for
1
h
and
by
saturating
its
binding
sites
by
DHT
.

The
effect
of
both
proteins
was
found
to
be
related
to
their
concentration
.

It
appears
that
the
binding
sites
of
albumin
provide
a
mechanism
for
retarding
androstenedione
uptake
by
the
erythrocytes
and
that
the
high
binding
affinity
of
SHBG
for
testosterone
facilitates
the
diffusion
of
this
steroid
out
of
the
cell
and
thus
,
displaces
the
chemical
equilibrium
within
the
cell
.

Glucocorticoids
and
lymphocytes
.

Increased
glucocorticoid
receptor
levels
in
antigen-stimulated
lymphocytes
.

Recently
a
2-
to
3-fold
increase
in
the
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
human
peripheral
lymphocytes
has
been
noted
after
in
vitro
mitogen
stimulation
.

Here
,
we
extend
these
observations
to
in
vivo
immunization
.

After
unilateral
immunization
of
adrenalectomized
male
rats
,
a
50
%
increase
in
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
per
cell
,
determined
by
binding
of
dexamethasone
,
was
observed
in
cell
suspensions
of
homolateral
lymph
nodes
over
those
from
the
contralateral
nonimmunized
side
of
the
same
animal
.

The
association
constant
for
dexamethasone
was
similar
in
both
groups
,
as
was
the
stereospecificity
for
various
steroids
,
the
time
course
of
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
association
,
and
cytoplasmic-to-nuclear
translocation
.

Despite
a
50
%
increase
in
the
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
per
cell
,
the
cells
from
the
homolateral
and
controlateral
lymph
nodes
were
equally
sensitive
to
the
inhibitory
effects
of
dexamethasone
,
as
determined
by
measurements
of
the
incorporation
of
radiolabeled
precursors
of
protein
,
RNA
,
and
DNA
,
or
measurements
of
in
vitro
cell
survival
.

Glucocorticoid
receptors
and
actions
in
rat
thymocytes
and
immunologically
stimulated
human
peripheral
lymphocytes
.

After
reviewing
briefly
our
earlier
studies
on
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
mechanisms
in
thymus
cells
,
we
have
outlined
results
from
the
following
two
areas
of
current
interest
in
our
laboratories
:
the
``
life-cycle
''
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
complexes
in
thymus
cells
,
and
the
levels
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
sensitivity
in
immunologically
stimulated
human
peripheral
lymphocytes
.

Several
of
our
results
on
energetics
and
kinetics
of
hormone
binding
to
glucocorticoid
receptors
in
rat
thymus
cells
seem
to
require
extension
of
the
simplest
model
of
hormone-receptor
transformations
in
intact
cells
.

ATP-depletion
experiments
suggest
the
existence
of
a
nonbinding
form
of
the
receptor
;
``
chase
''
experiments
suggest
reaction
of
hormone
directly
with
nuclear-bound
receptor
;
experiments
on
depletion
and
replenishment
of
cytoplasmic
receptor
using
cortisol
and
dexamethasone
suggest
the
existence
of
at
least
two
subpopulations
of
nuclear-bound
hormone-receptor
complex
.

We
have
found
that
mitogen
or
immunologic
stimulation
of
human
peripheral
lymphocytes
in
culture
leads
within
24
h
or
so
to
a
striking
increase
in
the
number
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
per
cell
.

We
believe
this
increase
may
be
due
to
partial
synchronization
of
the
cell
population
in
a
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
in
which
receptor
content
is
high
.

Contrary
to
the
widely
held
view
that
mitogen-stimulated
cells
become
insensitive
to
glucocorticoids
,
our
experiments
show
that
with
respect
to
inhibition
of
thymidine
and
uridine
incorporation
and
glucose
uptake
,
the
cells
are
highly
sensitive
to
dexamethasone
at
24
,
48
,
and
72
h
after
stimulation
with
concanavalin
A
.

Nuclear
glucocorticoid
binding
in
chronic
lymphatic
leukemia
lymphocytes
.

A
reliable
procedure
is
described
for
isolating
3H-triamcinolone
acetonide
(
3H-TA
)
receptor
complexes
from
purified
chronic
lymphatic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
lymphocyte
nuclei
,
based
on
the
use
of
carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine
(
CBZ-L-phe
)
to
prevent
breakdown
of
hormone-receptor
complexes
during
extraction
of
nuclei
with
0.6M
KCl
.

Using
this
method
,
specific
nuclear
glucocorticoid
binding
was
demonstrated
in
14/14
patients
with
untreated
CLL
.

No
correlation
was
found
between
levels
of
nuclear-associated
3H-TA
and
peripheral
white
blood
cell
count
or
rosetting
ability
of
circulating
lymphocytes
.

Multiple
closely-linked
NFAT/octamer
and
HMG
I
(
Y
)
binding
sites
are
part
of
the
interleukin-4
promoter
.

We
show
here
that
the
immediate
upstream
region
(
from
position
-12
to
-270
)
of
the
murine
interleukin
4
(
Il-4
)
gene
harbors
a
strong
cell-type
specific
transcriptional
enhancer
.

In
T
lymphoma
cells
,
the
activity
of
the
Il-4
promoter/enhancer
is
stimulated
by
phorbol
esters
,
Ca++
ionophores
and
agonists
of
protein
kinase
A
and
inhibited
by
low
doses
of
the
immunosuppressant
cyclosporin
A
.

The
Il-4
promoter/enhancer
is
transcriptionally
inactive
in
B
lymphoma
cells
and
HeLa
cells
.

DNase
I
footprint
protection
experiments
revealed
six
sites
of
the
Il-4
promoter/enhancer
to
be
bound
by
nuclear
proteins
from
lymphoid
and
myeloid
cells
.

Among
them
are
four
purine
boxes
which
have
been
described
to
be
important
sequence
motifs
of
the
Il-2
promoter
.

They
contain
the
motif
GGAAA
and
are
recognized
by
the
inducible
and
cyclosporin
A-sensitive
transcription
factor
NFAT-1
.

Three
of
the
Il-4
NFAT-1
sites
are
closely
linked
to
weak
binding
sites
of
Octamer
factors
.

Several
purine
boxes
and
an
AT-rich
protein-binding
site
of
the
Il-4
promoter
are
also
recognized
by
the
high
mobility
group
protein
HMG
I
(
Y
)
.

Whereas
the
binding
of
NFAT-1
and
Octamer
factors
enhance
the
activity
of
the
Il-4
promoter
,
the
binding
of
HMG
I
(
Y
)
suppresses
its
activity
and
,
therefore
,
appears
to
be
involved
in
the
suppression
of
Il-4
transcription
in
resting
T
lymphocytes
.

Reversibility
of
the
differentiated
state
in
somatic
cells
.

Analysis
of
de
novo
gene
activation
in
multinucleated
heterokaryons
has
shown
that
the
differentiated
state
,
although
stable
,
is
not
irreversible
,
and
can
be
reprogrammed
in
the
presence
of
appropriate
combinations
of
trans-acting
regulatory
molecules
.

These
properties
have
been
exploited
to
design
strategies
for
identifying
novel
regulators
of
cellular
differentiation
.

Phosphatidylcholine
hydrolysis
activates
NF-kappa
B
and
increases
human
immunodeficiency
virus
replication
in
human
monocytes
and
T
lymphocytes
.

We
have
tested
whether
breakdown
of
phosphatidylcholine
(
PC
)
initiated
by
exogenous
addition
of
a
PC-specific
phospholipase
C
(
PC-PLC
)
from
Bacillus
cereus
or
by
endogenous
overexpression
of
PC-PLC
induces
functional
activation
of
NF-kappa
B
and
increases
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(
HIV
)
enhancer
activity
.

PC-PLC-activated
hydrolysis
of
PC
was
found
to
induce
bona
fide
p50/p65
NF-kappa
B
binding
activity
in
three
different
cell
lines
of
human
or
murine
origin
.

No
significant
changes
in
the
turnover
of
other
cellular
phospholipids
were
detected
in
PC-PLC-treated
cells
.

Induction
of
NF-kappa
B
by
PC-PLC
did
not
depend
on
de
novo
synthesis
of
proteins
or
autocrine
secretion
of
either
tumor
necrosis
factor
or
interleukin
1
.

In
human
monocytic
and
lymphoblastoid
T-cell
lines
,
induction
of
NF-kappa
B
by
PC-PLC
resulted
in
clear
induction
of
luciferase
expression
vectors
placed
under
the
control
of
synthetic
kappa
B
enhancers
or
wild
type
,
but
not
kappa
B-mutated
,
HIV
long
terminal
repeat
constructs
.

HIV
replication
was
increased
by
PC-PLC
in
chronically
infected
monocytes
and
T
lymphocytes
.

NF-kappa
B
activation
promoted
by
addition
of
exogenous
PC-PLC
correlated
with
an
intense
production
of
diacylglycerol
.

However
,
addition
of
a
phosphatidylinositol-specific
PLC
from
B.cereus
also
induced
diacylglycerol
but
did
not
activate
kappa
B
enhancer-directed
vectors
.

PC-PLC-induced
NF-kappa
B
activation
could
not
be
blocked
by
a
specific
inhibitor
of
phorbol
ester-inducible
protein
kinases
C
.

These
results
indicate
that
a
cellular
transduction
pathway
,
dependent
on
specific
PC
breakdown
,
is
functional
in
T
lymphocytes
and
monocytes
and
may
be
used
by
various
transmembrane
receptors
to
activate
HIV
transcription
through
NF-kappa
B-dependent
induction
of
the
HIV
enhancer
.

Novel
mechanism
for
inhibition
of
human
T
cells
by
glucocorticoids
.

Glucocorticoids
inhibit
signal
transduction
through
IL-2
receptor
.

Interaction
of
IL-2
with
its
high
affinity
membrane
receptor
complex
(
IL-2R
)
present
on
activated
T
lymphocytes
induces
cell
proliferation
and
mediates
effector
functions
.

Glucocorticoids
inhibit
IL-2
production
by
inhibiting
TCR-mediated
signal
transduction
.

We
asked
whether
they
also
inhibit
the
action
of
IL-2
by
inhibiting
signal
transduction
through
IL-2R
.

Human
peripheral
blood
T
cells
,
stimulated
with
PMA
for
48
h
(
PMA
blasts
)
,
were
incubated
with
IL-2
in
the
presence
of
incremental
dosages
of
dexamethasone
(
Dex
;
10
(
-5
)
-10
(
-9
)
M
)
.

Dex
inhibited
the
IL-2-dependent
proliferation
of
PMA
blasts
in
a
dose-dependent
fashion
(
IC50
,
5
x
10
(
-8
)
M
)
.

Cell
surface
expression
of
IL-2R
alpha-
and
beta-chains
as
determined
by
immunofluorescence
analysis
was
not
affected
by
Dex
.

In
addition
,
Scatchard
plot
analysis
of
125I-labeled
IL-2
showed
that
Dex
did
not
affect
the
binding
of
IL-2
,
thus
suggesting
that
inhibition
is
due
to
a
postreceptor
effect
.

Inhibition
of
T
cell
proliferation
by
Dex
was
associated
with
decreased
IL-2-dependent
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
several
intracellular
proteins
and
decreased
phosphorylation
of
the
retinoblastoma
gene
product
Rb
,
a
protein
essential
for
controlling
the
progression
of
cells
through
the
cell
cycle
.

IL-2-dependent
IL-2R
alpha
expression
in
PMA
blasts
and
NF-kB
induction
in
resting
human
T
cells
were
also
inhibited
by
Dex
.

These
results
demonstrate
that
glucocorticoids
inhibit
preactivated
T
cells
by
down-regulating
signal
transduction
through
IL-2R
.

Chronic
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
infection
stimulates
distinct
NF-kappa
B/rel
DNA
binding
activities
in
myelomonoblastic
cells
.

The
relationship
between
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
(
HIV-1
)
infection
and
the
induction
of
NF-kappa
B
binding
activity
was
examined
in
a
myeloid
cell
model
of
HIV-1
infection
derived
from
the
PLB-985
cell
line
.

Chronic
infection
of
PLB-985
cells
led
to
increased
monocyte-specific
surface
marker
expression
,
increased
c-fms
gene
transcription
,
and
morphological
alterations
consistent
with
differentiation
along
the
monocytic
pathway
.

PLB-IIIB
cells
displayed
a
constitutive
NF-kappa
B-like
binding
activity
that
was
distinct
from
that
induced
by
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
or
phorbol
12-myristate
13-acetate
treatment
of
the
parental
PLB-985
cell
line
.

This
unique
DNA
binding
activity
consisted
of
proteins
of
70
,
90
,
and
100
kDa
with
a
high
degree
of
binding
specificity
for
the
NF-kappa
B
site
within
the
PRDII
domain
of
beta
interferon
.

In
this
report
,
we
characterize
the
nature
of
these
proteins
and
demonstrate
that
binding
of
these
proteins
is
also
induced
following
Sendai
paramyxovirus
infection
.

The
70-kDa
protein
corresponds
to
the
NF-kappa
B
RelA
(
p65
)
subunit
,
which
is
activated
in
response
to
an
acute
paramyxovirus
infection
or
a
chronic
HIV-1
infection
.

Virus
infection
does
not
appear
to
alter
the
amount
of
RelA
(
p65
)
or
NFKB1
(
p50
)
but
rather
affects
the
capacity
of
I
kappa
B
alpha
to
sequester
RelA
(
p65
)
,
therefore
leading
to
constitutive
levels
of
RelA
DNA
binding
activity
and
to
increased
levels
of
NF-kappa
B-dependent
gene
activity
.

The
virally
induced
90-
to
100-kDa
proteins
have
a
distinct
binding
specificity
for
the
PRDII
domain
and
an
AT-rich
sequence
but
do
not
cross-react
with
NF-kappa
B
subunit-specific
antisera
directed
against
NFKB1
(
p105
or
p50
)
,
NFKB2
(
p100
or
p52
)
,
RelA
(
p65
)
,
or
c-rel
.

DNA
binding
of
the
90-
to
100-kDa
proteins
was
not
inhibited
by
recombinant
I
kappa
B
alpha/MAD-3
and
was
resistant
to
tryptic
digestion
,
suggesting
that
these
proteins
may
not
be
NF-kappa
B
related
.

Transient
cotransfection
experiments
demonstrated
that
RelA
and
NFKB1
expression
maximally
stimulated
HIV-1
LTR-
and
NF-kappa
B-dependent
reporter
genes
;
differences
in
NF-kappa
B-like
binding
activity
were
also
reflected
in
higher
constitutive
levels
of
NF-kappa
B-regulated
gene
expression
in
HIV-1-infected
myeloid
cells
.

Presence
of
estrogen-binding
sites
on
macrophage-like
synoviocytes
and
CD8+
,
CD29+
,
CD45RO+
T
lymphocytes
in
normal
and
rheumatoid
synovium
.

OBJECTIVE
.

To
study
the
presence
of
estrogen-binding
sites
(
EBS
)
in
the
synovial
tissues
of
male
and
female
patients
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
and
in
age-
and
sex-matched
healthy
controls
.

METHODS
.

Both
type
1
(
high
affinity
,
low
binding
capacity
)
and
type
2
(
reduced
affinity
,
higher
binding
capacity
)
EBS
were
investigated
in
both
soluble
and
nuclear
fractions
of
homogenized
synovial
tissue
samples
by
a
dextran-coated
charcoal
method
.

To
determine
what
type
of
synovial
cell
was
positive
for
EBS
,
cryosections
of
synovial
tissues
were
immunostained
with
a
specific
monoclonal
anti-estrogen
receptor
antibody
(
anti-ER
MAb
)
using
both
immunofluorescence
and
immunoperoxidase
techniques
.

Double
immunostaining
with
the
anti-ER
MAb
and
with
specific
MAb
to
detect
different
macrophage
antigens
(
Ber-MAC3
,
MAC387
,
CD68
)
and
CD8+
T
cell
subsets
(
CD29+
,
CD45RO+
and
CD29-
,
CD45RO-
)
was
performed
.

RESULTS
.

Higher
affinity
EBS
were
found
mostly
in
nuclear
cell
fractions
of
either
RA
or
control
synovial
tissues
(
28
of
the
33
)
.

These
EBS
were
present
to
a

Immunostaining

Higher

consistent

CONCLUSION
.

It
is
conceivable
that
the
immunomodulatory
activity
exerted
by
estrogens
is
at
least
partly
mediated
through
their
interaction
with
EBS
